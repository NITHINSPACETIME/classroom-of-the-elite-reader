Looks like I was able to make it to the new year and see all of you again without incident. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It’s Kinuko… You remember, right? You didn’t forget, did you?</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">…Okay! So, yeah, anyway, I’m Kinuko… Or not, actually. Kinugasa Syougo here. Happy new year to you all. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Apparently, we also managed to release the first volume of the second-year arc without incident! Whether you’ve been reading since the first-year arc or you’re new to the series, welcome, and I’m looking forward to bringing you more stories this year as well. Also, the release of this book happens to coincide with the release date for the second </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Classroom </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">art book, it turns out. I hope you enjoy that, too. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Starting at the end of the month, we’re going to be holding an event to commemorate moving onto the second year of the story, so we’re looking forward to seeing people from all over the globe turn up at the venue! Figured I’d squeeze in some advertising about that here and there! </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Well, then, now that we’ve plunged into a memorable new arc, we’re moving forward with more things than ever before. Ayanokouji and the rest were still quite immature when they first started school, but they’ve sure started to show signs of maturing, haven’t they? With the changes they’re going through after entering their second year, and the arrival of new students, among other things, there’s certainly a lot to write about. So many things, in fact, that I ended up using the maximum number of pages allowed and had to cut a page from the postscript. Just barely managed to make it!</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Anyway, I couldn’t say too much this time because I had so little space to work with here, but I’m sure we’ll meet again soon, so I hope to see you back next time! Oh, and there’s more fun to be had over at the official website!</span></p>\n",
