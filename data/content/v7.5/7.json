People all over the world would be spending time with families or lovers, while some fortunate students here would spend it with their boyfriends and girlfriends. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Speaking of, it was almost time for the date I’d agreed to go on. I started getting ready, taking care to groom myself properly.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I’ve been here over eight months now, huh?” I muttered. Time had flown since I enrolled at this school. Maybe I enjoyed being here, at least a little. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I gently opened my balcony window, letting in a cold wind. I heard girls laughing. It sounded like they were heading to Keyaki Mall.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I should probably get going.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It was already past eleven o’clock, and I’d promised to go out with Satou Maya today. I had no idea what, if anything, was going to happen—but I had a feeling that this day would be significant. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Falling in love with someone. Considering them precious. Sharing happiness merely by being together. Elation. I wondered whether I’d ever be able to experience such strong feelings.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">This winter-vacation story began on December twenty-third, the day before Christmas Eve.</span></p>\r\n",
