The cruel reality that had confronted me without warning. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">An old apartment, filled with the last rays of the setting sun before dusk. A long, large shadow gently rocking from side to side, like the pendulum of a large clock. I&#160;couldn’t look directly at it, nor could I understand. A warm hand gently patting me on the head. A gentle smile that soothed my heart. A serious gaze that instilled within me a feeling of admiration. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">That silent, impassive expression filled me with despair. A strong, gentle person, who worked harder than anyone else and never gave up. It wasn’t right that a person like that shouldn’t be able to attain their dream. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I’m well aware that I’m contradicting myself, of course.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">And yet, I can’t forgive what was done. It’s hard for people to forge onward while harboring feelings of guilt, which is why they try to claim a sense of legitimacy under the banner of “justice.” As long as they have their own sense of justice, and can embrace that conviction, they can continue to fight.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The fragile heart I used to have—the old me—couldn’t support that kind of “justice.” However, the new me will.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">And by embracing that conviction, I…can most definitely defeat Ayanokouji Kiyotaka. I can send him back to where he belongs. If I don’t, there could be a second or third victim, and that is something I must avoid at all costs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ayanokouji stared at me as I stood there before him. If I was going to bring this all to an end…it was going to have to be right here and now. Then, I could move on to the next step. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">My real objective lay </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">after</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> defeating Ayanokouji Kiyotaka.</span></p>\n",
