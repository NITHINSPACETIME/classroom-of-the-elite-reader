But as a girl, I, Ichinose Honami, couldn’t know the details.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Let’s rewind to the day that the special exam started and tell the story from there.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Now that we’ve formed our groups, let’s do our best to get along, everyone!”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">That was what I said to all the members of my group before bedtime. Despite the many twists and turns, ups and downs, and ongoing drama, at least I now knew the allies who’d be facing this exam by my side.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Wang Mei-Yu-san, Shiina Hiyori-san, Yabu Nanami-san, Yamashita Saki-san, Kinoshita Minori-san, Nishino Takeko-san, Manabe Shiho-san, Nishi Haruka-san, Motodoi Chikako-san, Rokkaku Momoe-san, and I formed a group of eleven people. I was the only one from Class B, and there was also only one person from Class C. The rest were from Classes A and D. Manabe-san and Nishino-san seemed to be considered problem children even within their own class. In short, we were a group of oddballs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I didn’t know Mei-Yu-san well, and the remaining students who’d been brought in to fill the group didn’t really know each other either. I needed to hurry up and build some relationships—fast.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Let’s do our best, Ichinose-san.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Looking forward to working with you, Shiina-san. I’ve wanted to get to know you for a while.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Is that so? That’s an honor.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">But as for Class C—no, they were Class D now—we hadn’t really mingled with any of them at all. With Ryuuen-kun behind them, we could never get to a place where we could befriend them, no matter what we did. I supposed it was still unclear whether he really had stepped down or not, but since we’d finally put this group of girls together, I wanted us to get along.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The main thing we needed to avoid was someone being expelled if our group fell short. In other words, we needed to avoid someone invoking the solidarity rule and dragging another person down with them. Even if my first loyalty was to my comrades in Class B, now that we’d formed this group, I couldn’t play favorites. That was what I had told myself.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Wang Mei-Yu-san wasn’t actively participating. To be more precise, it felt like she </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">couldn’t</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> participate even if she wanted to. It would be simple for me to lend a hand, but this group was mainly composed of girls from Class A and Class D, many of them ones with big egos. If I stuck my nose in where it didn’t belong or tried to forcefully lead them along, they might decide they couldn’t trust&#160;me.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">So I decided to wait. If no one else took the initiative and started helping Wang Mei-Yu-san, I’d do something about it.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Hey, you’re Wang Mei-Yu-san, right?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Y-yes.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Shiina-san approached her, addressing her gently. Shiina-san had taken on the role of representative, even for a group like this. She was a really reliable person. I&#160;hadn’t put myself forward for the role, partly because Shiina-san had volunteered right away, but also because I didn’t think that we could really aim for the top spot with the members we had.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“This all must make you really nervous, huh? I mean, being surrounded by people you don’t know.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“U-um, well, I wouldn’t…”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“It’s completely understandable if you’re feeling bewildered, especially when you’re surrounded by strangers and told to get along with them.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Yeah. Exactly, Shiina-san.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">You couldn’t transform a group of strangers into friends just because you wanted to. It was the kind of thing that happened naturally or not at all. If you overthought it, you’d lose your footing and fail.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Hey, Ichinose-san. Have you ever had a boyfriend?” asked a girl from Class A.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Well… I’m embarrassed to say it, but no. I don’t have any romantic experience.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I see. Huh, you look like you’d be super popular, though. Maybe you’re the type of girl who has really high standards or something.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I don’t really think I am, but…I dunno.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Well, do you like any guys?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Huuuh?!”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The question was so sudden, I couldn’t help but panic.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“There are rumors going around. People say they see you hanging around with Nagumo-senpai a lot, just the two of you…”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Well, it was certainly true that I’d been working a lot with President Nagumo after joining the student council. I’d never imagined it would lead to rumors like this, though.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Setting aside whether I like him or not, I’m really not even on the student council president’s radar. He doesn’t look at me that way.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“No way, that can’t be.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Yeah. I mean, you’re </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">you</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">, Ichinose-san. It wouldn’t be strange if you and Nagumo-senpai started going out.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Either way, there isn’t anyone I like now…”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Wait, right now? So you </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">used</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> to like someone?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The girls started to grow excited all at once. This was a dangerous topic if you misspoke. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“No, you got it all wrong. Well, I suppose there was this senpai I admired, but before I realized that I had a crush on him, he graduated…” I trailed off, trying frantically to deny it.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The girls all exchanged looks before bursting into laughter.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“What? What? Did I say something weird?” I asked.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“No. It’s just, like, you’re answering these questions all so seriously.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Ichinose-san, you’re way too honest. It’s okay to just brush off stuff you don’t want to answer, okay?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Does that mean you dodged the question yourself earlier, Chikako-chan?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Eek.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">And so our girls’ night gathering grew lively once more. How should I put it? It felt like we could talk forever and never get sleepy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Hey, I’m not gonna answer any questions I don’t want to, okay?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Okay, then, how many times has someone confessed to you so far?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Huh? Um, three times. Well, if you’re including preschool, four times. I think. And if I add in that one other time, then five.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“See, you </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">did </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">answer!”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Nyaa!”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I was no good at talking about romantic stuff. I was so unfamiliar with anything of the sort, I was afraid I’d slip up and prove my ignorance.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Hmm, I wonder. Could it be that Ichinose-san is the kind of person who’s incapable of lying?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“You may be right.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The girls were getting really fired up. It was probably better to deny that.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“That’s not true. Really.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Really?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“For example, you might need to make a gamble or two during the special exams, right? I might try to mislead someone in a situation like that.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Then you’re fine with telling lies.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Hmm. I don’t think that’s quite right, either. I don’t think anyone really </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">wants</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> to tell lies. The best way to put it might be… I try to tell the truth as much as possible. Well, that’s not entirely right either. I guess I don’t like telling lies to avoid hurting people…”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Isn’t that kinda weird, though? I mean, wouldn’t you </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">want </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">to lie to avoid hurting people?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Yeah. I think lies told to avoid hurting people are definitely gentle, as lies go.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">But…that wasn’t really the case for me. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">That was right. This was the ordeal I’d set for myself.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I think a lie told to avoid hurting someone is just delaying the pain ’til later…”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">A single lie could lead to something much, much worse down the road. I never wanted to go through that again. Those painful days. That cruel time.</span></p>\r\n",
