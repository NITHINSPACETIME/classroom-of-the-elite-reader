class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.1\"> the teachers had taken care of preparations for the special exam the day before, because when I had arrived at school at the usual time in the morning, I noticed that the classroom was arranged differently than usual. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.1\">The five desks in the frontmost row where Horikita and some other students sat had been pushed slightly forward, and each of those desks had a tablet and accompanying stylus pen placed on them. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.2\">Additionally, each desk was sandwiched by partitions to prevent cheating. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.3\">I’m sure that the tablets were equipped with privacy screen filters in addition to the partitions. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.4\">The role of the partitions may have been to prevent indirect forms of communication, such as eye contact, for example. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.5\">Five new desks and chairs were placed in the back behind the last row of desks.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.1\">A maximum of five students—the ones who would be nominated—would sit in the frontmost row and solve problems. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.2\">With the teacher monitoring them closely, it would be difficult for them to cheat.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.1\">“Did you sleep last night?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.2\">I asked Horikita, who had just taken a seat behind me.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.1\">“I slept like normal. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.2\">There was nothing more I could do anyway, and all that was left was for me to take proper care of my health,” said Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.1\">“You had a fever during our first uninhabited island exam. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.2\">That was tough,” I replied.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.1\">“Shut up. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.2\">I’ll stab you,” snapped Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.1\">“Sorry,” I didn’t understand exactly why she was going to stab me, but I didn’t like being stabbed regardless. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.2\">I figured I’d just apologize.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.1\">“Feel calm?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.2\">she asked.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.1\">“Not at all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.2\">If anything, it may affect my performance, so I apologize in advance,” I replied.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.1\">At the very least, I was certain that neither Sakayanagi nor Ichinose would hit me with a frontal academic attack.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.1\">“Sorry, but I will absolutely not grant you protection,” said Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.1\">“Never, huh?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.2\">I replied.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.1\">Wow, what a position to be in, to be told from the very beginning that I could not receive any protection. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.2\">She seemed to be half joking, but I thought it best to take her words at face value. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.3\">Shortly afterward, after confirming that there were no absences and thus all the students in Horikita’s class were present, Chabashira-sensei wished us good luck and left the classroom.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.1\">It was becoming customary for these exams to be monitored by a homeroom teacher from another class rather than by their own homeroom teacher as a necessary measure to prevent unfairness. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.2\">Sakagami-sensei, the homeroom instructor for Ryuuen’s class, appeared in the classroom.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.1\">“My name is Sakagami, and I’ll be overseeing your class this time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.2\">I will now provide you with information about today’s special exam, the order of attack, and other things of note,” explained Sakagami-sensei.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.1\">After giving that short statement in a calm tone, Sakagami-sensei closed his mouth and kept it shut for a long while afterward. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.2\">He operated the tablet wordlessly, displaying the placement and notes up on the monitor.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span

class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.1\">After 10 turns (the first half), there will be a 40-minute break for lunch.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.1\">Conversation among yourselves and cell phone use are permitted except when nominated students are solving problems.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.1\">Students deemed unable to continue the examination due poor physical health or other circumstances will be treated as an elimination.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.33.1\">Any student found to be cheating will be immediately eliminated and the points that student has earned will be forfeited.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.1\">&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.1\">New information was included in the notes section, but there wasn’t anything particularly surprising. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.2\">Nominated students couldn’t do anything to escape from an attack by faking sick, nor would doing anything that might cause delays be allowed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.3\">Unlike a normal written exam, the questions would be different for each participant, so students couldn’t go hide in the bathroom and give each other the answers. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.4\">Even if you did run into a student from the other class while in the bathroom, it wouldn’t be a problem. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.5\">It was a pretty lukewarm restriction, and it didn’t matter when you could use your cell phone anyway. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.6\">The class configuration and the order of attack displayed on the monitor was more important.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.1\">First, the turn would begin with Class B—or rather, Horikita’s class—who would attack Ichinose’s Class C. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.2\">Next, Ichinose would attack Ryuuen’s Class D, and then Ryuuen would attack Sakayanagi’s Class A. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.3\">Finally, Sakayanagi’s Class A would attack Horikita’s class, completing one loop. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.4\">That would repeat for a total of ten turns. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.5\">Then, when we entered the second half of the exam, that order would be reversed, moving counterclockwise. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.6\">Horikita stared at the monitor to check the flow of attacking and defending, and then immediately directed her attention to her phone. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.7\">All of Horikita’s strategies against Ryuuen’s class had become unnecessary.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.1\">She must have moved on to pulling the offensive and defensive plans against Ichinose’s and Sakayanagi’s classes out of her head. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.2\">If we were to evaluate the situation only on a superficial level, having Ichinose’s class as one of our opponents was a positive, as they were likely to only take a straightforward approach. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.3\">On the other hand, facing off against Sakayanagi’s class was a negative. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.4\">In addition to her class’s overall strength, she had sharp insight and would work on fraying our nerves.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.1\">I figured that I would sit back and watch to see how it’d play out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.2\">Not that I could actually admit to that level of detachment.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.1\">I thought back to the sixteen categories featured in this special exam. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.2\">I didn’t intend to write off “elimination = expulsion,” but even looking back at the past two years of special exams, it was an unusually rare rule. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.3\">Someone like me normally wasn’t really at much of a risk. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.4\">I could make it through the academic category, but I was below average in areas like subcultures and performing arts. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.5\">Even though we could make three exemptions in advance and protect ourselves, there was still a reasonable chance of encountering a problem that I didn’t know the answer to. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.6\">I couldn’t rule out the possibility that I could be eliminated.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.1\">If Sakayanagi and Ichinose had come to some arrangement before the exam and decided that they’d make me the only elimination and we came in last place, then expulsion would inevitably await. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.2\">As a student, I didn’t think of this as an unreasonable rule—actually, this exam would be the only way some people would shine. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.3\">It was a good opportunity for new talent to be recognized.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.1\">“Now, we will begin the special exam. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.2\">On the first turn, this class, the first attackers, will be asked to choose a category and difficulty level and nominate five students,” explained Sakagami-sensei.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.1\">Sakagami-sensei gave the signal to begin the special exam. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.2\">The time limit for one attack and defense was a mere three minutes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.3\">That didn’t give us any leeway. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.4\">We had no time to think, just to communicate what we’d planned. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.5\">Since we would be spending far longer observing the movements of the other classes, the better course of action would be to hold discussions during those times. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.6\">The only time we’d hesitate would be when we hadn’t planned for something.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.1\">“We’re going in blind at the start. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.2\">We will proceed as we’ve discussed,” Horikita said firmly as she reached for the tablet that would be the main device. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.3\">I hadn’t participated in that discussion, so I didn’t have any information on what plan Horikita was going to use. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.4\">We had to verbally inform the teacher of the category, difficulty level, and nominated students. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.5\">Sakagami immediately displayed Horikita’s choices up on the monitor.</span></span></p>\r\n<p

id=\"kobo.50.1\">Kobashi Yume, Watanabe Norihito, Sumida Makoto, Ninomiya Yui, Shibata Sou</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.51.1\">&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.1\">The category was English, and Horikita’s target were students in Ichinose’s class who were not academically gifted. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.2\">It was a solid choice as a first move, one that reflected the core of her strategy—an attack made in a category that we could measure objectively. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.3\">Since we had zero points, we didn’t have anything to spend to change the difficulty. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.4\">Even in light of the fact that we were the first class to take a turn, choosing an academic subject was a solid move. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.5\">Horikita’s class, as well as the other classes, would use their first question as a stepping stone to get a grasp on question trends, the standard difficulty level, and so on.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.1\">However, there were many students in Ichinose’s class that had exceptionally balanced academic abilities. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.2\">All of the students enrolled in her class currently had an Academic Ability score of C– or higher. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.3\">Inevitably, the question of which students to nominate would be important but knowing who struggled in what subjects could only be determined from past inquiry or through individual interactions. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.3\">Next, Ichinose’s class attacked Ryuuen’s class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.4\">Their chosen category was Economics. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.5\">Ryuuen succeeded in defending one person; however, nobody else answered correctly, so they had only scored one point. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.6\">The class’s academic weaknesses were starting to show. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.7\">I’m sure that was painful for them, but there was no time to be discouraged. </span><span

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.2\">Sakayanagi had protected one person from Ryuuen’s class’s attack, and three of her people had answered the question

</span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.89.2\">How challenging would these problems be at difficulty level 1? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.89.3\">Surprisingly, there were many students who struggled with calculations in Horikita’s class, so much so that seven people had chosen it as a category to exclude. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.89.4\">The issue of handling Kouenji was of bigger concern to me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.89.5\">If we were to assume that keeping the promise Horikita made to him was a prerequisite, then that would mean she had to

for this. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.90.2\">However, there was little reason for the other classes to specifically go out of their way to

a promise. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.90.4\">With that in mind, what decision would Horikita make?</span></span></p>\r\n<p

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.116.1\">A multiplication problem. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.116.2\">Naturally, there was no choice but to solve it by mental calculation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.116.3\">The problem would be a breeze to do on paper, but much harder to do in your head. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.116.4\">Although it seemed pretty easy to me, from the way the nominated students were panicking, it was clear they were struggling to arrive at the answer. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.116.5\">The minute passed by in a blink of an eye, and the results showed…one student answered correctly.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.1\">Only Ishikura had answered the question correctly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.2\">The other two returned to their seats apologetically. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.3\">Sakayanagi’s choices in the first round were quite interesting, which made me curious. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.4\">Of all the students in Horikita’s class, Ishikura was the best at mathematics. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.5\">Even if mental calculation wasn’t exactly the same category, they were related enough. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.6\">There was no need for Sakayanagi to take the risk of her opponent getting a correct answer. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.7\">Even factoring in the seven who had excluded the category, there were several other weak students she could have targeted.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.1\">It wasn’t impossible that Sakayanagi was simply ignorant of Ishikura’s abilities; Sakayanagi had seen Ishikura tackling math problems in our final exams at the end of our first year. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.2\">It was difficult to imagine that Sakayanagi would have overlooked that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.3\">Was it possible that Sakayanagi decided that a student who was good at performing calculations, like Ishikura, wouldn’t be defended? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.4\">Maybe she’d chosen Ishikura to test her.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.1\">The first turn ended. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.2\">A not-too-shabby three points gained right out of the gate. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.3\">It was on to turn two, Horikita once again notified the instructor of the five students that she was selecting as the attacker. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.4\">Ichinose’s class failed to defend anyone we chose, but two of their students answered correctly, bringing them to a total of six points. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.5\">One student was protected in Ryuuen’s class and one person answered correctly, bringing their total to three points. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.6\">One student was protected in Sakayanagi’s class, and three students answered correctly, so they now had eight. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.1\">The gap between the classes was already widening in the second round. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.2\">Then came time for Horikita’s class’s second round of defending. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.3\">This time, Sakayanagi changed her choice of category from Calculation to Gastronomy, with a difficulty level of 1. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.4\">I had no idea what gastronomy was, but I was sure that Horikita knew and had prepared accordingly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.5\">Horikita decisively notified Sakagami-sensei of which five people she’d chosen for protection.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.121.1\">&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.128.1\">Unfortunately, all of Horikita’s choices for protection had been in vain. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.128.2\">Kouenji’s name was listed among the five nominations as early as the second round. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.128.3\">This was a lengthy battle, and even Kouenji was likely to be nominated in at least one round. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.128.4\">That in itself was nothing special, but what was important was whether Kouenji could defend himself without help.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.129.1\">&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span

id=\"kobo.132.2\">However, Kouenji got it incorrect as he’d left the answer field blank. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.3\">From behind him, I saw he hadn’t even picked up his stylus. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.4\">As for the four other students, unfortunately, it looked as though Keisei had mistakenly given the wrong answer; he smacked his desk in frustration immediately after the correct answer was announced. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.5\">The results were disappointing, but our class still received three points—we were up to six.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.1\">“Hey, I saw that, Kouenji! </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.2\">I knew you weren’t gonna take this seriously…!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

id=\"kobo.134.1\">He wasn’t screaming his head off in a rage or anything, but Sudou was angry. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.134.2\">His snappy reprimand came across more like he was scolding Kouenji on behalf of the class rather than venting a personal frustration. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.134.3\">If Kouenji wasn’t going to even try to solve the problem, it was no wonder Sudou felt frustrated. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.1\">“No need to blame me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.2\">If you are dissatisfied, simply protect me moving forward,” said Kouenji.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.1\">“Damn it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.2\">You’re so selfish,” said Sudou.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.1\">His disapproval was understandable, but until Kouenji got a second question wrong, Sudou didn’t have to worry too much about it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.2\">The class probably felt a sense of security with Horikita, who was unconcerned despite Kouenji’s refusal to answer any questions. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.3\">It would’ve been a problem if Horikita didn’t keep her promise and made it her mission to expel Kouenji, but she probably didn’t want to use her precious protection slot without a good reason. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.4\">Horikita stood confidently; Kouenji glanced over at her for a moment, grinned, and returned to his own seat. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.5\">Meanwhile, Keisei, who had answered the problem incorrectly simply out of ignorance, came over to Horikita to apologize.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.138.1\">“I’m sorry, Horikita. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.138.2\">Maybe it was because I was nervous, but the answer just didn’t come to me… I should have known it,” he said.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.1\">“I’m not that worried about you. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.2\">If they attack you again in the same category, I’ll defend you when the time comes, okay?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.3\">said Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.140.1\">Sakayanagi would not overlook an opening to exploit. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.140.2\">That was why Keisei, aware of the danger and solid in his faith Horikita would protect him, nodded meekly to her, to which she responded with a nod of her own. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.141.1\">The battle had begun in earnest. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.141.2\">Every time a problem was posed, the students would concentrate wholly on their cell phone screens, coming up with their own countermeasures. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.1\">But while the leaders didn’t have to worry about being nominated, they had less time to rest than anyone else. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.2\">How would you submit questions to your opponents? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.3\">How prepared were you to adapt to the moment and change your nominations? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.4\">Horikita, having little time to so much as speak, hurriedly scrawled notes in her phone or, at times, in an open notebook. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.5\">Then came Sakayanagi’s attack for the third turn.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.1\">Once again, it was the Gastronomy category. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.2\">The difficulty level remained the same, at one. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.3\">I had thought that Sakayanagi wouldn’t have chosen the same category because the previous question had been an easy one, with three students answering correctly, but apparently our opponent had a plan. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.4\">Did Sakayanagi see Kouenji and Keisei’s mistakes as an opportunity to exploit? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.5\">They were both powerful classmates. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.6\">Horikita had chosen to protect Keisei, just as she had told him she would before, and had then selected her remaining four nominations. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.7\">However…</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.1\">That was exactly right—attacking and defending was a matter of reading your opponent’s moves. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.2\">If you attacked in the same category, it was a given that the defender would take action to prevent an elimination. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.3\">There would be no point in targeting Keisei since there was a possibility that he would be protected. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.4\">However, the same was also true for Kouenji. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.5\">How did Kouenji and Keisei differ in Sakayanagi’s mind? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.6\">And how had she been so accurate? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.7\">One thing was certain: Sakayanagi had gotten a good read on our class’s mind.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.154.1\">Kouenji stood up from his seat once again and walked proudly to the front. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.155.1\">“Kouenji-kun, I can’t force you to make a promise to the class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"

had no other choice but to make his plea while Kouenji walked past. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.156.3\">However, Kouenji had no doubts he’d be protected in the following rounds, so once again his answer was blank. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.156.4\">His classmates couldn’t contain their

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.157.1\">The issue of the third turn was simpler: a commonsense problem. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.157.2\">If Kouenji had done what he was supposed to, our class would have had the chance to get a perfect score even if he wasn’t offered protection. </span><span

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.158.2\">As long as Kouenji was only looking out for himself, there was nothing we could do about it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.158.5\">Everything depended on his skill. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.158.6\">However, Ryuuen’s class was lagging both

Sakayanagi sticking with the same choice of category rather than the issue of the difficulty level. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.168.2\">With Kouenji reaching elimination soon, did Sakayanagi intend to go on the offensive? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.168.3\">This was the first time that

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.170.2\">I think they might see this as a chance to get rid of Kouenji-kun,” replied another.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.171.1\">Kouenji, after deliberately refusing to answer questions in the Gastronomy category twice in a row, no longer had any way out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.171.2\">Should Horikita protect him now that he was in danger of elimination? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.171.3\">Or should we guess that Sakayanagi deliberately wouldn’t go after Kouenji, because he was already close to being eliminated, and thus would be protected? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.171.4\">No, Sakayanagi’s choice

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.172.1\">Our situation was different from those of the other classes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.172.2\">It was an issue that went beyond tactics. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.172.3\">If Kouenji were to refuse to answer again, he would be the first elimination in our class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.172.4\">Since Horikita had promised to protect him well in advance, she had no other choice but to do so if she wanted to keep her promise. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.172.5\">If the opponent came at us

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.184.1\">Yousuke was most surprised of all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.185.1\">“You sure about this, Suzune? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.185.2\">I mean, if Kouenji messes this one up, he’s eliminated, right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.185.3\">said Sudou.</span></span></p>\r\n<p

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.186.2\">However, Horikita just quietly stared ahead. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.186.3\">The only person whose facial expression didn’t change a bit at this turn of events was Kouenji—the very person who should have absolutely been panicking.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.187.1\">“Heh heh heh</span></span><span

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.190.1\">To people who didn’t think about the matter too deeply, it looked like Horikita had abandoned Kouenji, that she was someone who went back on her promises. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.190.2\">It was a betrayal. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.190.3\">I couldn’t say throwing away the trust of the class was the best course of action, considering everything that had happened since the Unanimous Special Exam. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.190.4\">Kouenji said nothing further and sat down at the front like the other students.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.191.1\">The problem that they were presented with was certainly more difficult than the previous two. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.191.2\">I caught glimpses of students exchanging glances and cocking their heads to the side in confusion. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.191.3\">I didn’t know how much Kouenji knew about gastronomy, but there was an uneasy feeling in the air. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.191.4\">The young man who hadn’t even picked up the stylus pen the previous two times had finally made a move. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.191.5\">Watching him, I got the impression that his hands moved swiftly, not even a hint of hesitation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.191.6\">But would his answer reflect that confidence?</span></span></p>\r\n<p

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.197.1\">“Wow, so someone was worried after all, huh?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.197.2\">hollered Sudou. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.197.3\">He was teasing, but there was also a note of relief in his voice. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.198.1\">“You have an active imagination,” said Kouenji.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.199.1\">I didn’t know what Kouenji was thinking, but his reaction was sensible. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.199.2\">One more wrong answer and he would’ve been a candidate for expulsion. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.199.3\">What concerned me was Horikita. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.199.4\">Even if Horikita assumed that Kouenji would’ve taken the problem seriously if he were backed into a corner, had Kouenji gotten it wrong, things would’ve been bad.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.200.1\">Horikita needed to defend him, even if she were confident that he could’ve answered correctly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.200.2\">The class was clearly anxious, but not even Yousuke could make sense of it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.200.3\">The only exception was, of course, the young man in question. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.200.4\">Kouenji walked past me, to my side, and stood in front of Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.201.1\">“If you have an explanation, I’d like to hear it,” muttered Kouenji.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.202.3\">asked Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"

Kouenji smiled.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.207.4\">It appears as though I’ve hastily jumped to a conclusion.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.208.1\">“If we’ve cleared up your misunderstanding, could you please return to your seat? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.208.2\">You’re blocking the monitor,” said Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.209.1\">Their conversation seemed to imply that Horikita had abandoned Kouenji, and it did nothing to quell everyone’s bewilderment, apart from perhaps Kouenji himself. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.209.2\">I could have done something to reassure the students by explaining Horikita’s thinking and the usefulness of not protecting Kouenji, but I remained a neutral observer. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.210.1\">Horikita chose not to reassure anyone; she had other aims. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.210.2\">In fact, she didn’t even bat an eye at their confusion. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.210.3\">She didn’t nominate Kouenji as a candidate for protection during Sakayanagi’s attack on the fifth turn, either. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.210.4\">However, Kouenji’s name also disappeared from the list of targets to be attacked.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.211.1\">From the perspective of the other students, Kouenji would have been a good target to choose, as they would have seen this as their chance to eliminate him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.211.2\">After all, he wasn’t being protected. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.211.3\">However, Sakayanagi chose other targets. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.211.4\">Kouenji had been the only person to correctly answer the problem in the gastronomy category with a difficulty level of 2, so it was possible that Sakayanagi had recognized Kouenji was too tough to pick off and chose another tactic. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.211.5\">Many of the students here likely had this misunderstanding of the situation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.212.1\">Kouenji had answered the question using his own knowledge. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.212.2\">This meant that Sakayanagi could no longer expect he’d make mistakes, which in turn meant that Horikita took a risky gamble that could have cost her the trust of her allies. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.212.3\">This time, however, Kouenji’s name was not on the list of candidates. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.213.1\">Horikita’s face clouded over upon seeing this. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.213.2\">“I guess our opponent won’t fall for it so easily…” she said.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.1\">Because I was seated in close proximity to Horikita, I overheard her muttering to herself. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.2\">During the first half of the battle, the turns flew by, and I enjoyed the action. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.3\">The number of students who made mistakes steadily increased as time went by, and finally, at the end of the seventh turn, Ishizaki from Ryuuen’s class went down as the first student to be eliminated. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.4\">In the following turn, turn eight, Sotomura and Ijuuin from Horikita’s class were eliminated simultaneously, while Isoyama and Yano from Ryuuen’s class were the next to go in that same turn. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.5\">Then it was Kamuro from Sakayanagi’s class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.6\">By the end of turn ten, the first half, Hondou from Horikita’s class, Morofuji from Ryuuen’s class, and Yamamura from Sakayanagi’s class had been eliminated.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.215.1\">&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.1\">Nine eliminations in all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.2\">That might’ve sounded like a lot, but it would get even more brutal in the second half. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.3\">A number of students had eaten up two of their three allotted mistakes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.4\">Ichinose’s class was the only one that still had zero eliminations. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.5\">At first glance, that appeared to be a fine play on Ichinose’s part, but appearances could be deceiving.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.227.1\">“Your strategy worked well, Horikita-san,” said Yousuke, coming over to congratulate her.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.1\">“I knew that her stance wouldn’t change, even on this special exam. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.2\">I’ve managed to box her in,” said Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.1\">I wondered how many of our classmates had noticed what was happening as Horikita unleashed her strategy against Ichinose. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.2\">The reason the number of eliminations in her class remained at zero was because Horikita intentionally kept the number of students within range of being eliminated to five. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.3\">Ichinose would absolutely protect her classmates. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.4\">Knowing that, Horikita had distributed her attack nominations to avoid creating a sixth person in range of elimination.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.1\">Ichinose, on the other hand, seemed to have continued to protect those five students in danger of elimination, even though she knew Horikita would spread out her attacks. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.2\">After those five students had gotten to that point, Ichinose hadn’t gotten even one successful protection because she was protecting them instead. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.3\">She didn’t want to risk leaving the five students at risk of expulsion, after all. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.231.1\">“She really doesn’t back down. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.231.2\">It was a ridiculous long-term strategy. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.231.3\">Even if she could defend them in the first half, it’s going to get much, much more difficult later,” said Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.232.1\">Illustrating her point was the fact that Ichinose’s class had the highest number of students who had gotten one question wrong out of the four classes.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.233.1\">“In the second half, Ichinose-san will have to defend her classmates from Ryuuen-kun. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.233.2\">I’m sure that will be painful,” added Yousuke.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.234.1\">“There is the option of abandoning protecting those five in the second half of the exam, she could just do that, but…” said Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.1\">Even so, this was Ryuuen. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.2\">He wasn’t strategic either.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.236.1\">“Anyway, it’s down to us. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.236.2\">We have a good chance to eke out a one-point win,” said Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.237.1\">Sakayanagi’s class had pulled far into the lead early on, but Horikita was nipping at her heels. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.237.2\">By herself, Horikita seemed a half step behind when it came to anticipating Sakayanagi’s moves, but her classmates were skillfully making up the gap.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.238.1\">“Regarding the rate of questions answered correctly, putting aside cases of successful protections, it seems that the school expects that approximately half of the students will be able to answer each problem. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.238.2\">When the difficulty level increases by one, the rate of correct answers is 20 percent, and when it’s at difficulty level 3, it drops to about 10 percent or so,” said Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.239.1\">At a difficulty level of 3, we couldn’t reliably expect anyone to get a correct answer, but that option wasn’t used too often because it cost two points. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.239.2\">If the opponent defended from it via protection, that would result in a big loss. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.239.3\">I imagined it wouldn’t be used too frequently even in the latter half of the exam. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.239.4\">The battle for the top spot was the most interesting part, yes, but the struggle to stay out of final place was also heating up. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.239.5\">Ryuuen’s class was in a particularly tight spot.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.1\">Assuming that the trends we’d seen continued, and assuming that more people would be eliminated, the line to cross for first place would be somewhere between fifty and fifty-five points. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.2\">In the second half alone, Ryuuen would need to gain at least thirty points just to survive. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.3\">Generally, students with high academic ability tended to be more difficult to target; however, they were difficult to protect too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.4\">We saw a smattering of students who got something wrong in unexpected categories. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.1\">It also seemed like questions in areas not related to academics, like subcultures and gastronomy, were often easier than those related to academics, even when they were technically set at the same difficulty level. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.2\">Incidentally, I got a question wrong once myself in an academic category. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.3\">The question was “What is the animal that was bred in a zoo and became a worldwide sensation because of how cute it looked when it stood up on its hind legs?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.4\">from the News category.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.242.1\">I had no idea what animal it was, so I just randomly wrote “dog” as my answer, which prompted an icy look from Horikita. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.243.1\">The correct answer was red panda.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.249.1\">for our lunch break, I told Horikita to give me a few minutes of her time and brought her out into the

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.251.1\">I never imagined that she would take me to task for something like that

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.251.3\">I’m curious about a few things,” I replied.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.252.1\">“It was a joke. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.252.2\">What is it you

honest, I haven’t been paying any attention to the order. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.254.2\">It wasn’t in alphabetical order or in order of boys first and then girls afterward, was it?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.254.3\">asked Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.255.1\">“I can’t say for certain what the order

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.255.2\">That means they were likely shown in the exact order in which the leader said them.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.256.1\">“I see. </span><span

</span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.256.4\">asked Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.257.1\">“What got my attention were Sakayanagi’s nominations from turns two through four in the first half of the exam. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.257.2\">Kouenji was targeted three times in a row, and in every case, he was the first one nominated,” I explained.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.258.2\">If I remember right, Yukimura-kun got the question wrong on the second turn too, didn’t he?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.258.3\">asked Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span

threat as well if you looked at him in terms of his abilities alone, but overall, Keisei should be seen as more of a problem. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.259.3\">Yet, Sakayanagi didn’t even nominate Keisei on the third turn, after he had made a mistake,” I answered.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.260.1\">“Don’t you think that she’s simply not so good at anticipating my moves? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.260.2\">She might’ve decided that I’d protect Yukimura-kun because I thought he was important, right?”

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.263.1\">It would be better to eliminate as many students as possible. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.263.2\">If there was a good chance that he was not going to be protected, then Sakayanagi should have kept attacking.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.264.1\">“Is she perhaps wary of his knowledge?” </span><span

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.265.1\">“If so, she wouldn’t have attacked Kouenji from the very beginning. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.265.2\">It doesn’t explain why she nominated him three times in a row,” I replied.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.266.1\">“…Is Sakayanagi-san aware of the promise that I made to Kouenji-kun?”

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.267.1\">“I think that’s a safe bet. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.267.2\">With that promise in hand, Kouenji wouldn’t take this exam seriously. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.267.3\">She must have calculated that you wouldn’t have defended him until he got two questions wrong,” I replied.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.268.1\">The chances that Kouenji would have taken the questions seriously from the start or that Horikita would have defended him right away weren’t zero. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.268.2\">Sakayanagi would have changed strategies in that case.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.269.1\">“Why didn’t she target him from turn five on, then? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.269.2\">I had chosen not to protect him then, remember?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.269.3\">asked Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.270.1\">“She didn’t precisely because you made that choice. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.270.2\">If her intention was to make you get rid of one of your protection slots by using it on Kouenji, and that plan was no longer viable, she must have felt like it was a waste of time—disadvantageous to her, in fact,” I reasoned.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.272.1\">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.272.2\">You said as much yourself before the exam. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.272.3\">You said that you had a plan in place to minimize the damage in the event that our class came in last place. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.272.4\">That option was to let Kouenji be eliminated, wasn’t it?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.273.1\">“…So you knew.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.274.1\">“Your promise with Kouenji was that you wouldn’t ‘expel’ him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.274.2\">You’d let him be ‘free.’ </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.274.3\">In this special exam, you haven’t asked anything of Kouenji, so it goes without saying that you’ve kept your promise to give him his freedom. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.274.4\">As for the other part, about you not expelling him…hypothetically, if Kouenji were to be the only one to be eliminated, he wouldn’t be expelled if he uses his Protect Point. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.274.5\">Problem solved,” I answered.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.275.1\">Kouenji had won that Protect Point on his own, by winning in the Uninhabited Island Exam, granting him the right to nullify an expulsion.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.276.1\">“That’s right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.276.2\">I hadn’t promised that I would protect Kouenji-kun’s Protect Point. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.276.3\">As long as he isn’t expelled, I’ve fulfilled my promise. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.276.4\">He would have no right whatsoever to resent me over it,” said Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.277.2\">There would be no risk of anyone getting expelled if we were in last place in that scenario.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.278.1\">“I’m sure I worried everyone, though,” said

did explain, Kouenji would know what you’re trying to do, right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.279.2\">I answered.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.280.1\">“Yes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.280.2\">But he seemed to catch on right away. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.280.3\">Personally, it would have been easier for me in the second half of the exam if he had been eliminated early.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.281.1\">That was why Kouenji had answered correctly on his own—it would have annoyed him to have his Protect Point stripped away.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.282.1\">“It’s reasonable to assume that, because of Sakayanagi’s personality, she decided that she didn’t want to erase the pressure of possible expulsion from our class, Horikita.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.283.1\">“Her personality comes through in every one of her actions. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.283.2\">But why didn’t Kouenji-kun give correct answers right from the start?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.284.1\">“Not even I know the answer to that question. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.284.2\">Maybe he just decided he could hold out until the third question. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.284.3\">Anyway, there may be students in the class who are leaking information.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.285.1\">That was invaluable to keep in mind, not just for the special exam but for after as well.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.286.1\">“Thank you. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.286.2\">I’ll be sure to keep that in mind,” said Horikita.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.287.1\">“That’s all I needed to say. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.287.2\">What are you going to do for lunch?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

you?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.289.1\">“I think I’ll do the same. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.289.2\">Kei will probably be staring at her phone the entire time,” I replied, turning toward the classroom as I said that. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.290.1\">Horikita nodded in apparent understanding. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.290.2\">Kei had gotten through the first half of the exam unscathed, as she hadn’t been nominated by Sakayanagi even once. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.290.3\">However, I couldn’t say that came as a relief to her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.290.4\">In as few as three questions, she could join the ranks of the eliminated. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.290.5\">She probably wanted to drill as much knowledge as possible into her head, even if it was just a stopgap measure.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.291.1\">&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p

id=\"kobo.296.1\"> Special Exam had begun, and was progressing slowly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.296.2\">Ryuuen weathered his first attack from Ichinose’s class, but with only one out of five protections being successful and no students answering correctly, no one felt especially good about it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.296.3\">That was understandable: academics were a weak point in Ryuuen’s class.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.297.1\">Even putting aside the students who had excluded Economics, the category that Ichinose had chosen, nearly half of the students in Ryuuen’s class felt anxious about the category. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.297.2\">On the other hand, Ichinose’s class, which had been attacked by Horikita’s class, had scored a total of four points. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.297.3\">A three-point gap had already opened by the end of the first turn, and a gloomy feeling hung over the class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.297.4\">However, that wasn’t because they didn’t gain points.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.298.1\">“Okay then! </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.298.2\">As the attacker, who do you plan to nominate from Class A?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.298.3\">said Hoshinomiya, cheerfully guiding the leader.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.299.1\">But Ryuuen didn’t budge. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.299.2\">He stared at his cell phone in calm silence.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.300.1\">“Hello? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.300.2\">Can you hear me?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.300.3\">asked Hoshinomiya.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.301.1\">She called out again from the podium just to be sure, but Ryuuen remained still. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.301.2\">As was understood from the explanation of the rules, the nomination time was steadily ticking away, one second at a time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.301.3\">Though Hoshinomiya figured that Ryuuen would have surely decided on who they would attack on the first turn and belt it out, Ryuuen still hadn’t moved in the first minute. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.301.4\">Normally, you would’ve expected to hear the voices of classmates piping up with people asking, “Are you okay?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.301.5\">but no one did. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.302.1\">Even if the majority of people in this class wanted to say something, they couldn’t. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.302.2\">Now, in battle, Ryuuen exuded an even more overwhelming and intimidating air than ever before. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.302.3\">It was rare for Hoshinomiya to see Ryuuen’s class so tense. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.302.4\">Ryuuen’s classmates, however, were a little more used to it—this was an everyday occurrence. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.302.5\">It was something they saw all the time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.302.6\">It would’ve been quicker if Kaneda, the general adviser, made a move on Ryuuen’s behalf, but since he tended to wait for instructions from Ryuuen, no one was bothered by his silence.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.303.1\">At times like this, uncertain classmates tended to turn their eyes to Katsuragi. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.303.2\">Although he was a transfer from another class, the students considered him Ryuuen’s chief strategist. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.303.3\">In addition to Katsuragi’s overall strengths in OAA, he didn’t cower before Ryuuen’s surly temper. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.303.4\">If all it took were defiance, Ibuki would have qualified, but in Katsuragi’s case, he had reasons for acting the way he did.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.304.1\">Katsuragi, the person the other students would usually turn to, didn’t move a muscle. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.304.2\">With eyes closed and arms folded across his chest, he allowed time to pass while he was on the attacking side. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.304.3\">Had he figured that calling out to Ryuuen in this situation wouldn’t change anything and thus gave up on even trying? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.304.4\">Or was he merely confident? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.304.5\">In either case, the students could only watch in silence.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.305.1\">“Hey, listen, it’s still only the first turn, okay? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.305.2\">Three points isn’t that big of a difference, so you shouldn’t get too worked up about it,” Hoshinomiya said, offering them encouragement.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.306.1\">They just hadn’t pulled ahead on the first attack, that was all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.306.2\">It might have seemed a little biased, but she couldn’t remain silent in the face of the students before her and their anxieties. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.306.3\">That was her official stance, anyway.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.307.1\">In reality, if Sakayanagi’s class pulled too far ahead, it’d be hard for Ichinose’s class, the class that she was in charge of, to win. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.307.2\">If Sakayanagi’s class continued to win high scores time and time again with their cowardly strategies, her own class would have no chance of winning. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.307.3\">It was a calculated move on her part to say something, but as Hoshinomiya watched the class continue in silence, she realized that she had made an error in judgment. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.307.4\">Even though many students questioned Ryuuen’s lack of action, few actually felt anxious about it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.307.5\">Normally, silence often brought about negative consequences, but in this class, it was a unique strength they had cultivated.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.308.1\">Hoshinomiya accepted the unusual situation: with nearly two minutes having passed now and still no attempt to so much as utter the names of their nominees. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.309.1\">That silence holds secrets.</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.310.1\"> Hoshinomiya started thinking that way for the first time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.310.2\">In that brief moment, what fantastic strategy would they come up with? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.310.3\">An ideal set of nominations against Sakayanagi’s class, where they would fail to protect anyone and get many of the questions wrong? </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.312.1\">“O-oh, w-w-wait a minute! </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.312.2\">Let me enter them,” said Hoshinomiya, quickly tapping the names in.</span></span></p>\r\n<p

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.332.1\">Three of the four remaining students had answered correctly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.332.2\">That meant Ryuuen’s class had given the opposing class four points while he had only gotten one. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.332.3\">A bad start. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.332.4\">Not much could be expected from them. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.332.5\">Hoshinomiya had been impressed as she looked at the students, who seemed surprisingly calm, but now, inwardly, she had taken that feeling back. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.332.6\">She realized that they weren’t as good as she thought after all, and it was unlikely that they’d be able to crush Sakayanagi’s class.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.333.1\">From that point onward, you couldn’t say that Ryuuen’s strategy had been skillful, even if you were feeling especially generous. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.333.2\">Most of the people he had nominated had been the same people he’d nominated in the first turn. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.333.3\">Although he occasionally switched it up, possibly as a diversion, he continued to nominate Kitou, Kamuro, Hashimoto, Yamamura, Machida, Sanada, Satonaka, and Matoba once every two turns or so. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.333.4\">Sakayanagi started to predict his pattern and adjusted protections accordingly.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.334.1\">Even so, Ryuuen didn’t drastically change his nominations. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.334.2\">He just spent more turns at the bottom of the rankings. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.334.3\">On the fifth turn, the midpoint of the first half of the exam, Hoshinomiya noticed something inexplicable. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.334.4\">Even though some students had already answered two questions incorrectly and they ought to be panicking…</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.335.1\">“They’re all so calm,” she muttered.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.336.1\">They couldn’t get themselves out of last place because they had a weak defense. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.336.2\">Since they clearly had a lower percentage of correct answers to problems compared to the other classes, they weren’t earning points where they should have been. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.336.3\">However, even in this situation, few students were feeling nervous. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.336.4\">Hoshinomiya strolled around the classroom, pretending to monitor them, and casually peaked at each student’s phone.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.337.1\">They weren’t just playing around, but rather, they were browsing various websites and checking out videos to study the categories they were weak in. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.337.2\">Was it simply that they were too nervous to speak up? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.337.3\">Or maybe because they were under Ryuuen’s control? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.337.4\">That thought had occurred to Hoshinomiya too, but…</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.338.1\">“Kaneda-kun, it doesn’t appear that

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.338.3\">asked Hoshinomiya, suddenly reaching out to Kaneda. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.338.4\">He wasn’t even touching his phone while the rest of the students were silently preparing.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.339.1\">“I always make an effort to study, and I don’t like cramming at the last

class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.341.1\">Hoshinomiya, slightly taken aback by Kaneda’s response—which just fell short of being “</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

arrangement has two stipulations. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.373.6\">First, that she would simply not expel him, and second, that she would allow him his freedom. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.373.7\">Yes?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.374.1\">“Yeah…” replied Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.375.1\">“There is no advantage to be gained for her in wasting one of her precious protection slots to continuously defend him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.375.2\">At the very least, she would wait and see what happens until he has been targeted once and has answered a question incorrectly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.375.3\">She would need to do at least that much in order to win. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.375.4\">Wouldn’t you agree?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.375.5\">asked Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.376.1\">“But Horikita’s honest. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.376.2\">If she won’t protect him, her class will be upset,” said Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.377.1\">“If they’re going to be upset about something as trivial as that, she would sooner let them be upset. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.377.2\">While the actual fulfillment of her promise is important, if she wasted her protection slots on Kouenji-kun, she’d be unfit to lead.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.378.1\">While Sakayanagi was explaining this, Horikita’s class had decided on which five students they would protect. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.378.2\">The monitor refreshed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.378.3\">It now showed that none of Horikita’s protections had been successful, and the five students that Sakayanagi had nominated would be tasked with solving a problem.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.379.1\">“What do you think? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.379.2\">As expected, she’s left Kouenji-kun undefended,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.380.1\">Hashimoto had to let the matter drop.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.381.1\">“…Okay, sure. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.381.2\">But what’s the point in forcing ourselves to get a point from Kouenji, anyway? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.381.3\">The dude’s weirdly smart. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.381.4\">He’s far more likely to get correct answers compared to some nobody, right?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.382.1\">“Do you think so? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.382.2\">He’s a capricious fellow, undeniably. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.382.3\">He’s such a free spirit that he even defies Horikita-san. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.382.4\">He’s under no obligation to take these questions seriously. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.382.5\">He might even answer them incorrectly on purpose,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.383.1\">Sakayanagi was unwavering in her conviction as she spoke. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.383.2\">It was almost like she was claiming she could read the future. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.383.3\">Hashimoto waited for the monitor to refresh, wondering if she had that kind of power. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.383.4\">The results showed that Kouenji did indeed answer incorrectly, just as Sakayanagi had predicted. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.383.5\">He was one step closer to elimination. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.384.1\">“Well, you took a risk, but you got a point. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.384.2\">Brilliantly done, Princess,” said Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.385.1\">Hashimoto felt momentarily relieved, but that relief was dashed away in the following turn. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.385.2\">As soon as their attack phase began, Sakayanagi, without even a moment’s hesitation, went ahead and announced Kouenji’s name as the first of her nominations. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.385.3\">In the same category, to boot. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.385.4\">It was as though she were announcing to everyone that she was targeting him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.385.5\">Even Sakayanagi’s other classmates stirred. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.385.6\">Kamuro raised an objection.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.386.1\">“Hold up, what are you doing? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.386.2\">You picked the same category, so it’s obvious that they’re going to protect Kouenji,” said Kamuro.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.387.1\">“You’re not saying he won’t be protected this time either, are you?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.387.2\">asked Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.388.1\">“Yes, I would bet on it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.388.2\">That’s why I nominated him.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.389.1\">It was an absurd prediction on Sakayanagi’s part. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.389.2\">He peered at the monitor from his seat and waited for the results.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.390.1\">&#160;</span></p>\r\n<p

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.394.1\">“Wait, seriously…?! </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.394.2\">What is Horikita thinking?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.394.3\">Hashimoto blurted out.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.395.1\">And once again, Kouenji had answered the question incorrectly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.395.2\">That kind of mistake was unthinkable from him.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.396.1\">“I’m not taking Hashimoto’s side in this, but what made you think that he wouldn’t be defended the second time?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.396.2\">asked Kitou.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.397.1\">“The logic is the same as it was in the first round. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.397.2\">You can make up to two mistakes, so there’s no need for Horikita-san to defend him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.397.3\">If she were to, she’d want to leave that until the last possible minute. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.397.4\">However, I imagine she would prefer Kouenji-kun to answer correctly.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.398.1\">“…I see. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.398.2\">Which means that now Horikita has no other choice but to protect Kouenji, even if she doesn’t want to,” muttered Kitou, now convinced.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.399.1\">As long as there was room for Kouenji to make a mistake, Horikita would not allocate a protection slot for him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.399.2\">In other words, Sakayanagi took a risk and targeted him so that slot would be occupied in the later turns. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.399.3\">That’s how Kitou had interpreted what she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.399.4\">The fact that the problems in the gastronomy category were easy weren’t really a problem. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.399.5\">Every class was feeling out the difficulty of the problems.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.400.1\">“Sorry I doubted you, Princess. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.400.2\">You really did think it through. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.400.3\">If that’s what you were going to do, though, you could’ve gone after Kouenji starting from the first turn, right? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.400.4\">You could have made them waste their protection slot for eight turns. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.400.5\">We basically lost a turn, then,” said Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.401.1\">“I was ninety-nine percent certain that she would not defend Kouenji-kun, but the reason I chose to target him on turn two was to ensure their complacency. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.401.2\">It was a strategic opening move to lure our opponents into making a second blunder. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.401.3\">What would have happened had I made my attack on turn one and Horikita-san had decided to defend him? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.401.4\">It would have been harder going.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.402.1\">They would have run the risk of being led around by the nose by their opponent, by a deceptive protection slot. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.402.2\">Sakayanagi didn’t want to give her opponent any leeway to control the pace.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.403.1\">“He’d answered an easy question incorrectly the first time, so I was able to determine he’d be unlikely to answer the second correctly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.403.2\">At any rate, the results were superb. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.403.3\">All thanks to the information you have provided me.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.404.1\">Hashimoto,

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.405.1\">“Now then, let’s finish off Kouenji-kun, shall we?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.405.2\">said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.406.1\">On the fourth turn, Sakayanagi nominated Kouenji for a third time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.406.2\">Again, he was the first person in her list of nominees. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.406.3\">It shocked the class.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.407.1\">“It is to make doubly sure, you see. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.407.2\">This is a threat that I will go after him again if they show me an opening. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.407.3\">Thanks to your gathered intelligence, Hashimoto-kun, we know the inner workings of Horikita-san’s class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.407.4\">However, our opponent does not know how much has been leaked to you, Hashimoto-kun.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.408.1\">“I got it… You’re right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.408.2\">They’ll feel they have to protect him,” said Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.409.1\">Sakayanagi chose the same category, gastronomy, but she raised the difficulty to 2. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.409.2\">She was also checking to see what the increase in difficulty for the problems would be like. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.409.3\">Although it’d be a waste if it turned out Kouenji were protected, he didn’t dare point that out.

Kamuro.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.422.1\">“That’s an opening. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.422.2\">We can crush him in one go,” said Kitou. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.422.3\">He smelled blood in the water.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.423.1\">“You may be right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.423.2\">And I’m sure trust in Horikita is dropping, along with their morale,” said Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.424.1\">But while Hashimoto saw Horikita’s decision not to use her protection slot on Kouenji as a sign of internal strife in the enemy class, Sakayanagi had come to a different conclusion.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.425.1\">“I thought she might protect him unconditionally or that this was our shot at eliminating him, but it seems Horikita-san has something else in mind. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.425.2\">If we target Kouenji-kun any further, we will only end up playing into her hands.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.425.3\">With a giggle, Sakayanagi opened her phone. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.425.4\">“At any rate, I’m impressed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.425.5\">It appears you’ve actually kept your opponent in mind.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.426.1\">Sakayanagi wondered silently if Ayanokouji was lurking in Horikita’s shadow. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.426.2\">Which one had come up with this strategy? </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.427.1\">“I’d guess this wasn’t his doing,” said Sakayanagi. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.428.1\">If Ayanokouji were pulling the strings, she’d have heard about it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.428.2\">Sakayanagi would have felt the influence of some alien mind. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.428.3\">She only detected the faint whispers of Ayanokouji in Horikita’s thinking.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.429.1\">She’s been watching him more closely than anyone, so I’m sure she’s grown</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.430.1\">, thought Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.431.1\">The lines were drawn. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.431.2\">Sakayanagi was not going to fall behind Horikita in this battle.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.432.1\">“The problem is…”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.433.1\">For Sakayanagi, who held Class A’s future in her hands, there wasn’t any class in particular that worried her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.433.2\">More than one working in collusion, however, would be a problem—that was Sakayanagi’s sole concern. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.433.3\">Although Sakayanagi’s agents continued to perform reconnaissance after the special exam was announced, there had been no signs of any such moves from the other classes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.433.4\">However, perhaps they’d been working in secret.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.434.1\">All Sakayanagi could do was look for signs of that kind of an arrangement between classes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.434.2\">As of now, the likelihood that the other classes were working together was nearly zero. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.434.3\">Nothing was out of the ordinary.</span></span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",
