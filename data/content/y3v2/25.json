About two minutes later, Kushida-san went to the entryway and put on her shoes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as I thought she would leave the room without so much as a glance back&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Thank you for the meal today. I appreciate it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...You&apos;re not so bad, I suppose. Unlike a certain someone, you can actually say thank you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not just about you, Horikita-san. I don&apos;t really want to thank anyone else either, but I guess it&apos;s just a habit. I make a point of putting it into words, so it just comes out unconsciously.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kushida-san nonchalantly&#xa0;stated that her previous remark was also an unconscious one.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see... Well, regardless of your true feelings, words are important, aren&apos;t they?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In truth, there was a certain satisfaction to be had even from those words of gratitude, however superficial.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I thought she would leave, she immediately turned back toward me for some reason.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;By the way, how are things with the special exam? Have you been able to predict what kind of rules it&apos;ll have?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m narrowing down the possibilities. I intend to report a few potential strategies to the class tomorrow.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This sort of discussion was impossible with Ibuki-san around.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wondered if that was why Kushida-san had deliberately chosen to leave a little later.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So you&apos;re even wary of her, of Ibuki-san.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Honestly, she&apos;s not really at a level where I need to be cautious, you know. But just in case, I was on my guard, thinking she might try to probe me about our thoughts on the special exam rules during the meal. But there was no sign of that, or rather, I guess the thought never even crossed her mind.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no doubt she&apos;d stopped by the room purely for the meal.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Still, Kushida-san avoided the topic just in case.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To be honest, it was a helpful consideration.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s a special exam and we don&apos;t know the rules, but do you still plan on winning?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What a thing to ask. Of course, I do. The conditions are the same for every other class, you know.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But Class C has Ayanokouji-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A sharp gaze and words that struck at the core without any reservation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was as if she were testing my mental state all over again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s strange, isn&apos;t it? When we first enrolled, I never would have imagined it, but now, just hearing his name makes my body instinctively tense up and feel intimidated, and I can no longer see him as an opponent I can defeat.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I acknowledged the undeniable fact and sighed at my own weakness.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even so, I&apos;ll fight with the belief that I can win. Isn&apos;t that the bare minimum attitude to have?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Kushida-san answered, averting her gaze from me for a moment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I thought I&apos;d get to bask in a little bit of bliss once we made it to Class A, but now we&apos;re in a position where we have to run for our lives. We&apos;re like rabbits being chased by a lion, you know? It&apos;d be pretty uncool if we keep losing like this, I think.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With her great pride, Kushida-san continued to play the part of an honor student and was extremely concerned with appearances. Though she never put it into words, there was no doubt she&apos;d been deeply irritated about being placed in Class D and having to content herself with being in a lower-ranked class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, during the Unanimous Vote Special Exam, her true nature was exposed to the entire class, and her circumstances changed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She now had to interact with people she despised, like me, and was forced to keep fighting, even as she was being wounded.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The status of Class A, which she finally, painstakingly obtained.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The fact that it was now facing the threat of being toppled in an instant must have been causing her considerable mental anguish.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Either way, it doesn&apos;t look like you can do it by yourself, Horikita-san.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Even if I wanted to, I can&apos;t deny it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For now, if you figure out anything that could be a hint for the special exam, let me know. I&apos;ll try thinking about it my own way from there.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes, of course. Even so...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kushida-san, who showed her willingness to cooperate even as she unreservedly voiced her complaints.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I never thought I&apos;d hear you declare your support. You do have a genuinely kind side to you, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I praised her frankly. In response, Kushida-san scoffed, then looked at me with a fixed smile, her eyes unmoving.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I just love the cute me who pretends to be kind. It&apos;s because I&apos;m aware I have an awful personality that I can afford to treat even you with an angelic attitude, Horikita-san. So then, I expect your strength isn&apos;t just for show.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With that, Kushida-san gave a small, mocking laugh, opened the door, and left.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see... I guess that means I&apos;m still a poor judge of character.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Far from being exasperated, I found myself inadvertently impressed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&apos;d been shown Kushida-san&apos;s way of life&#x2014;one that was endlessly concerned only with how she presented herself to others.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her final words echoed in the back of my mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&apos;<em>I expect your strength isn&apos;t just for show</em>.&apos;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&#x201c;&#x2014;I am expecting that of myself, as well.&#x201d;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After the door closed, I let out a breath and returned to the living room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A new special exam would begin the next day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But I had things to do, so it wasn&apos;t yet time to rest.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&#x201c;Well then&#x2026; I suppose I should clean up.&#x201d;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Suppressing my slight reluctance, I turned my gaze to the table.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kushida-san always ate gracefully, but Ibuki-san was the surprising one.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While it wasn&apos;t uncommon for people to leave rice grains in their bowls, she&apos;d eaten every last one.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&#x201c;I can praise her for that, at least, but everything else is as hopeless as ever.&#x201d;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Spilled miso soup and bits of side dishes weren&apos;t only on the table, but also where she&apos;d been sitting.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her uniform skirt must have been stained as well.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&#x201c;I wish she&apos;d have at least some awareness that her daily conduct and manners are being observed&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as I was about to reach out, I stopped.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A thought suddenly occurred to me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see... That sort of thing is certainly plausible, isn&apos;t it...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The school imposed a week-long special exam with no explanation of the rules.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Did it refer to this one week, or to the time after this one week?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The answer hadn&apos;t been obtained.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Therefore, every class must have been racking their brains.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2014;The possibility is by no means low.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Chabashira-sensei&apos;s words, actions, and attitude.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What if they were, in a way, the best hint she could give us?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She wanted us to make her think that we were different from when we first enrolled.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Such cold words reflected the true feelings of our teacher, who&apos;d been watching our immature class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If the idea that surfaced in my mind was correct, I had to take action immediately, within the day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was because whether or not I could control that person by tomorrow was directly linked to victory or defeat.</p>",
