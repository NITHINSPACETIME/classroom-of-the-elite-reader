I have something I&apos;d like to talk about.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;S-S-S-Suzune!? Wh-what are you doing here? I mean, uh, it&apos;s not a problem or anything!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A mechanical pencil was clutched in the hand of the flustered, gesticulating Sudou-kun.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh? Horikita-san?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From behind the bewildered Sudou-kun, Onodera-san poked her head out as she spoke.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I glanced at the entryway and saw two pairs of shoes. Even I had my suspicions, however slight.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Was I interrupting something?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;N-No, you&apos;re not interrupting anything at all! We were just studying together, that&apos;s it!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Studying?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, there were Sudou-kun&apos;s glasses and the mechanical pencil in his hand. More importantly, both of them were still in their school uniforms.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As the student council president, there seemed to be no problems to point out.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Well, y&apos;see, about this special exam. They said we don&apos;t gotta study yet, but it&apos;d be bad if there was a written test, right? So I figured we should prepare, even just a little.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even though I hadn&apos;t yet told them our plan for tomorrow, he&apos;d already begun to prepare countermeasures. I doubt anyone could have predicted seeing him like this back when we first enrolled.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s admirable, but make sure you get Onodera-san back to her room safely before curfew, all right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;O-Obviously! So what do you want, showing up without any notice?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He tried to shoo Onodera-san toward the living room with his hand, but I stopped him. Since there was a guest, it would be faster to explain it to both of them at once.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;May I come in for just a moment? This is something I&apos;d rather people from other classes not overhear.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah... of course you can.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I stepped into the entryway and closed the door.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then I beckoned Onodera-san, who was watching me with curiosity, over to the entryway.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The special exam that starts tomorrow. I can&apos;t say for certain, but I have an idea about the kind of rules it might have.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I lowered my voice slightly and explained it to the two of them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Seriously? What kinda rules d&apos;you think they are?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;When Chabashira-sensei announced the special exam, her attitude was colder than usual, wasn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kanji and the others were complaining about it, yeah. Sounded like they were trying to figure out why.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not that she was being cold because she couldn&apos;t afford to be otherwise; I believe she was actually being curt on purpose.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Huh? On purpose? What&apos;s the point of doing that? She&apos;ll just make people hate her, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I interpreted that attitude as the only hint the teacher could give us... I think she wanted to make us remember the time shortly after we enrolled.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You mean back in our first year, right? Yeah, she was pretty damn cold back when we enrolled.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou-kun glanced back to meet Onodera-san&apos;s eyes, recalling the past, and they both nodded in understanding.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do you remember the first special exam we took as first-year Class D?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hmm? The uninhabited island exam... wasn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Onodera-san, who&apos;d taken a few more steps forward to stand beside Sudou-kun, murmured as she tried to recall.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Your guess isn&apos;t technically wrong, Onodera-san. However, right after we enrolled, we were put through a certain month-long test without any explanation of the rules&#x2014;the root cause of all our struggles for the past two years.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As soon as I said that, Sudou-kun immediately remembered, and Onodera-san followed suit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh, right. They were checkin&apos; stuff like tardiness, absences, and our attitude in class. That&apos;s how our Class Points went to zero, wasn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A surprise from the school that gave the children who&apos;d just become first-year high schoolers points equivalent to 100,000 yen every month. Repeated tardiness and private conversations. The teacher simply continued to watch over us quietly, without a word of warning.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Class D, who enjoyed and reveled in it all without a single thought for what was behind it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The price for that was steep, and it led to the two years of hardship I just mentioned.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So it&apos;s that exam again this time?... Come to think of it, she did say somethin&apos; like, &apos;show me you&apos;ve grown.&apos; Guess she meant for us not to make the same mistake again.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou-kun, who&apos;d been properly listening to Chabashira-sensei&apos;s words, picked up the pieces of her statement himself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s how I interpreted it. That&apos;s why I thought it might be a special exam with the same rules.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That seems totally plausible. Actually, now that you mention it, it almost feels like that&apos;s the only possibility.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Onodera-san heard my idea and I could tell from her expression that it clicked.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course, I can&apos;t completely rule out the possibility of an exam with some kind of unrelated rules. But our classmates studied intensively for the last special exam, and a fair amount of frustration has built up. Continuing this way doesn&apos;t guarantee we&apos;ll get good results.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There couldn&apos;t have been many students who could maintain such high motivation, like these two.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This whole &apos;prepare for anything&apos; approach, honestly, it&apos;s not a good fit for our class.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s certainly easier just focusing on one thing.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course, it will be a gamble. If it&apos;s announced on the day that it&apos;s a written exam after all, our chances of winning might disappear. However...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t know what you think, Sudou-kun, but I&apos;m on board with Horikita-san&apos;s plan. Studying isn&apos;t a bad thing, but you get less efficient if you overdo it. As a strategy for the class to win, I think a simple one is more effective and not a bad idea.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. I want to share this with the entire class today and have them lead a thoroughly disciplined life starting tomorrow. A single case of tardiness could be the difference between winning and losing.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s class and Ichinose-san&apos;s class had many honor students to begin with.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They could maintain a high standard for their usual perfect attendance and general conduct without even trying.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A mistake on the first step meant we had absolutely no chance of winning.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then we gotta make damn sure no one finds out about this. If Kanji and his crew go blabbing to other classes, we&apos;re screwed.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re absolutely right. Whether or not we can get a head start on the first day is a crucial factor.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, putting the other classes aside, there was no way Ayanokouji-kun couldn&apos;t have figured out something of this level. Class C must have already factored this possibility into their plans. And that meant... just as Karuizawa-san feared, the information might be passed to and shared with Class D...</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Ayanokouji&apos;s probably figured it out.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even without me voicing my thoughts, it seemed Sudou-kun had gotten the picture.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was proof that he now fully understood that Ayanokouji-kun was a formidable opponent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even so, the other classes may not know. Will you cooperate?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah. I&apos;ve even got an idea how to make those guys stick to the rules and keep their mouths shut.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He thumped his chest with his fist and puffed it out. He looked very dependable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But just keeping Ike-kun and the others in line won&apos;t be enough. Our class has one major obstacle.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;An obstacle?... Ah, I see. Is that why you came here, Horikita-san?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">An image of the problem child who never listened to anyone came to both Onodera-san&apos;s and Sudou-kun&apos;s minds.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He isn&apos;t a student who is normally late or absent without reason, but his classroom attitude and private life are highly problematic. If he alone were to drag us down, our class would have absolutely no chance of winning.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To win the special exam, getting his cooperation became our most important task.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But that&apos;s impossible, ain&apos;t it? Gettin&apos; that guy to do what he&apos;s told.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Simply asking him will likely be impossible. However, I have an idea. To that end, I am thinking of visiting Koenji-kun&apos;s room, but I&apos;ve never been there before. Therefore, I would like a classmate to accompany me, just in case.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Koenji&apos;s room? Right now? Yeah, that does sound a little dicey. If that guy goes feral, even I wouldn&apos;t be able to stop him easily. Nah, you made the right call not goin&apos; alone.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That wasn&apos;t the sort of thing I was worried about, but...</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t feel like pressing the issue, so I let it slide.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So, that&apos;s the situation. Would you mind if I borrowed Sudou-kun for a bit? I believe I can have him back in ten or twenty minutes, at the earliest.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If that&apos;s the case, be my guest. Well then, I&apos;ll just hang around and wait.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou-kun readily agreed on the spot, and after he quickly put on his shoes, the two of us stepped out into the hallway.</p>",
