Still, it wasn&apos;t that there were no customers at all, just a sparse few. Then, just as her tea was delivered, another student came in and sat down at the table next to Shiraishi&apos;s.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From over her shoulder, she could hear the electronic chime of a tablet being operated and an order being placed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Have I kept you waiting?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The charming words came from behind her. A voice, clear and unadulterated, unpolished yet powerful, reached Shiraishi&apos;s ears.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Not at all. I only just arrived myself.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you really sure this was the right place to meet?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. It&apos;s easy for our voices to carry even when we&apos;re back-to-back with the sofa in between, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s true that it&apos;s easier to talk since there are few customers, but on the flip side, that means we inevitably stand out. Anyone who enters can spot us easily, and it&apos;s unavoidable that we&apos;ll leave an impression.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no panic in her voice, but she gave off a strong sense of caution.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The situation, where she could only hear her companion&apos;s voice, worked to Shiraishi&apos;s advantage.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no way for the person in question to know that she&apos;d been placed in such a unique environment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Visually speaking, that may be so. However, it&apos;s impossible for anyone to imagine our relationship from this back-to-back situation. The fact that we might catch someone&apos;s eye also means that they catch ours. As long as we remain calm, there won&apos;t be any problems.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They&apos;d simply come to the unpopular restaurant individually. Seeing two students from different classes&#x2014;no, different school years&#x2014;the number of people who could imagine they arranged to meet and were conversing on purpose was extremely limited.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I think an ordinary student would just assume we&apos;re here waiting for two different people. However, there are a few individuals I need to be wary of. If one of them, Ayanokouji-senpai, were to see this...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even if he didn&apos;t understand it just from witnessing the situation, he would still unconsciously commit this pairing to memory and likely retrieve it later as needed.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">On that day, at that time, Shiraishi and Nanase sat back-to-back in the restaurant. Had they been pretending to be strangers while having a conversation they didn&apos;t want overheard? He would begin a line of deduction an ordinary person could never reach.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you understood that, may I ask why you still took that risk?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The risk you&apos;re concerned about, Nanase-san, has already been eliminated. Ayanokouji-kun just entered the gym with Ichinose-san. At the very least, he won&apos;t be out for another hour.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Surely you didn&apos;t ask Ayanokouji-senpai directly, or have someone else find out for you, did you? Even that would be cause for suspicion.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her tone of voice remained the same, but Shiraishi didn&apos;t miss the faint anxiety it contained.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. The only words we exchanged today were morning greetings.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then how did you ascertain Ayanokouji-senpai&apos;s location?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How I procured that information is a trade secret.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She used a line she heard from Ayanokouji himself during a previous exchange.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Forgive my rudeness, but if you used your friend Nishikawa-senpai, I believe she would be ill-suited for the task. There&apos;s no way Ayanokouji-senpai wouldn&apos;t notice if she carelessly tailed him. It&apos;s entirely plausible he would suspect it was your doing, Shiraishi-senpai, since you two are close. Or does she perhaps possess some hidden talent?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was a subtle shift in Nanase&apos;s speech that an ordinary person wouldn&apos;t have noticed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Only when she spoke the name Nishikawa was there a truly faint, yet deliberate, emphasis.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re aware that she isn&apos;t capable of handling such a major role, aren&apos;t you? My apologies, but Nishikawa-san is merely a friend. Your attempt to read so deeply into things is meaningless.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Is that so?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s all well and good to meticulously check for any missteps on my part, but you&apos;ve exposed your own foolishness quite spectacularly, Nanase-san. To let an uninvolved student discover the existence of your second phone and then to be overheard speaking with someone who was supposed to have left the school.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re right. I was careless in that regard.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve taken measures to sufficiently silence Hashimoto-kun and Morishita-san, who happened to witness it. It&apos;s possible it may eventually reach Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s ears, but for the time being, it should be fine.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So you took care of it for me. Thank you very much.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiraishi picked up the saucer with her left hand, then placed the fingers of her right hand on the handle of the cup.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Shall we get to the point now? Contacting me is a clear violation of the rules.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I am fully aware that up until now, you&apos;ve lived your life at this school as a completely ordinary student. However&#x2014;I, too, have a job that only I can do, so this was unavoidable. Please, I need your help.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What is it you want me to do?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I want to get Ayanokouji-senpai expelled. As soon as possible, and at a time he can&apos;t predict.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Closing her eyes, Shiraishi mulled over Nanase&apos;s words, letting them sink in deep.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a tone of impatience, not one of deceit. She assessed its credibility within herself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I sympathize with your feelings, but I must decline to offer my assistance.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why...is that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s because I am, strictly speaking, an observer. From the very beginning, I was never given any role beyond that. It is precisely because I didn&apos;t get involved in anything for these past two years that, from Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s perspective, I was nothing more than &apos;Female Student A&apos; from another class&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then why have you started to close the distance now? Even if he doesn&apos;t know who you are, Shiraishi-senpai, he might recognize that you&apos;re not an ordinary student.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I suppose so. But it can&apos;t be helped, can it? Through an ironic twist of fate, he and I ended up in the same class. By chance, we ended up in adjacent seats. And by chance, an opportunity arose for the two of us to speak in the classroom one morning... Given all that, there&apos;s no way I can possibly suppress this impulse...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiraishi smiled as she recalled that event, the morning they&apos;d spoken alone in the classroom.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I will spend my days with Ayanokouji-kun as a classmate. For now, I just want to purely enjoy this environment. Nothing more, nothing less, simply as an observer. Besides, that nuisance, Sakayanagi-san, has voluntarily withdrawn from the school.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is that so... I understand. It seems it will be difficult to rely on you as things stand, Shiraishi-senpai.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To take a breath, Nanase took a sip of the freshly delivered iced milk through a straw.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Have your fellow students also been given a similar role, Shiraishi-senpai? That is, the role of an observer?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Who knows. The possibility that they&apos;ve been given the same role as me isn&apos;t zero, but I don&apos;t know. All that is required of us is to spend three years as ordinary students. It&apos;s as simple as that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I will take action while Ayanokouji-senpai is still within reach. If I cannot receive your cooperation, Shiraishi-senpai, then I may have to find one of your fellow students who will cooperate.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even if you threaten me, cooperation is a difficult matter.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I am from that side.&quot;<sup id=\"fnref-1-87c39c1f-e305-518e-87f6-94b3a5050825\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-87c39c1f-e305-518e-87f6-94b3a5050825\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Aren&apos;t you leaving a little something out? &apos;Supposedly,&apos; isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...My apologies. It is true that my position may be rather ambiguous. However, isn&apos;t it precisely because my position is different that I&apos;m not in violation of the rules?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s true. The reason I accepted your invitation today, Nanase-san, was because I wanted to reassure you regarding the matter with Hashimoto-kun and Morishita-san. I have no intention of cooperating in any other matter.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;At least give me some information... Please, just disclose the names of your associates. After that, we&apos;ll handle&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you wish to know, I suggest you ask your superiors directly. Tsukishiro-san, was it? You have someone reliable you can turn to, don&apos;t you? Not that I&apos;m fond of him.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiraishi placed her finished cup on its saucer and rose from the sofa.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I understand that you will not be cooperating for the time being. However, there is just one thing I&apos;d like you to remember. May I state it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That if I am expelled before Ayanokouji-senpai&apos;s fate is decided... things may very well head in a direction that Shirogane-sensei would not desire&#x2014;I ask that you please bear this in mind.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Very well. I shall keep it in mind.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiraishi answered as such without so much as a nod, and left the restaurant before Nanase.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"87c39c1f-e305-518e-87f6-94b3a5050825\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-87c39c1f-e305-518e-87f6-94b3a5050825\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-87c39c1f-e305-518e-87f6-94b3a5050825\">[1]: </a>Nanaese&apos;s statement &quot;I am from that side&quot; (&#x305d;&#x3061;&#x3089;&#x5074;&#x306e;&#x4eba;&#x9593;&#x3067;&#x3059;) is her saying she&apos;s aligned with the anti-Ayanokoji faction (&quot;superiors&quot;, Tsukishiro etc.) Shiraishi responds with &#x4e00;&#x5fdc; which means &quot;for the time being&quot;, &quot;tentatively&quot;, or &quot;In principle&quot; she is essentially saying &quot;Your position isn&apos;t as strong as you&apos;re making it sound&quot;, she dismisses Nanase&apos;s declaration.</p></li></ol>",
