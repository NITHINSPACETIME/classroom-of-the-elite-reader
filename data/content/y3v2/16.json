Would you mind if I took a moment of your time?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t mind. What&apos;s up?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you&apos;d like, would you care to have lunch with me in the cafeteria today?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">An unexpected invitation from my neighbor. As if he&apos;d been eavesdropping on Shiraishi&apos;s words, Yoshida, who was sitting a short distance away, spun around and jogged over to us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey, let&apos;s grab a bite to eat, Ayanokouji!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a completely transparent, fake attempt to make it seem like he was the one inviting me all along.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, his expression conveyed at least the determined spirit of someone aiming for the Best Supporting Actor award.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiraishi looked on fondly at the transparent Yoshida, her eyes narrowed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In this situation, there was probably only one course of action I could take.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What a coincidence to get two invitations at once. Is it alright if Yoshida joins us?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If it was about something personal or exam-related, we might need to speak privately, so I decided to check.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course, that&apos;s fine. It&apos;s not like I was planning on having any particularly difficult discussions. In that case, may I have Nishikawa-san join us as well? I thought it might be more fun with more people.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It soon became clear that it was just a simple invitation to a meal, so I had no reason to refuse either.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is that okay with you too, Yoshida?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What, Shiraishi and her group are coming too? Well, I guess that&apos;s fine.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This, too, was a transparent act, and he couldn&apos;t hide his happiness completely. If anything, his desperate attempt to put on a deadpan expression backfired, a grin leaking out, making him very easy to read.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Such a transparent guy, Yoshida must have been irresistibly amusing to Shiraishi&#x2014;perhaps even cute? She watched him the whole time with a warm smile.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Morishita-san, would you care to join us as well?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as Nishikawa approached and a small circle formed, Shiraishi turned her gaze behind me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m quite alright, cock-a-doodle-doo.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Seemingly having no intention of joining the four of us, Morishita refused with that strange turn of phrase.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto glanced my way, but perhaps having heard it was just a normal meal, he made no move to join us and walked toward the hallway alone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since the exam was just announced, he was probably making a move to gather information and scout things out, trying to use his time effectively in his own way. After that, Morishita also left the classroom by herself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Unfortunately, it seems we&apos;ve been turned down.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t worry about someone like Morishita. Come on, let&apos;s go.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yoshida said to Shiraishi, his eyes turning toward the classroom exit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Wait a minute. There&apos;s someone else I want to invite, is that alright?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Someone else? Ah, you mean Hashimoto?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, Hashimoto already left the classroom.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh, is that right? He&apos;s usually the one talking to you. Then who is it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I turned my gaze to the back of a certain student who was still sitting in their chair.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The other three followed my line of sight, understood who it was I wanted to talk to, and were surprised.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Seriously?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Dead serious.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After making a grim face, Yoshida looked over at Shiraishi and the others.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Are you sure, Shiraishi? If we mix <em>him </em>in, things could get ugly.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Fearing it would not be an enjoyable meal, he left the decision up to her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Fufufu. Doesn&apos;t that sound interesting? I&apos;m all for it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To Yoshida, who hoped she would refuse, Shiraishi gave her smiling permission to welcome him. Yoshida seemed bewildered by this, but Nishikawa also enthusiastically agreed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sounds like fun. I&apos;m in, too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Geez, girls are so gutsy when it comes to this kind of stuff...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Or perhaps, they were simply enjoying seeing Yoshida flustered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Watching the smiles on Shiraishi and Nishikawa&apos;s faces, I couldn&apos;t help but think so.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In any case, I was glad to have received permission. After getting the okay from the two girls, I made my way to that person&apos;s desk&#x2014;Kitou.</p>",
