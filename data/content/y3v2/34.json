It appears she isn&apos;t here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was brought to a rest area on the second floor with a row of vending machines, but Yamamura was nowhere to be seen; instead, several first-year students were gathered and chatting on a bench.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter how faint Yamamura&apos;s presence was, if there were several people gathered nearby, and she were hiding next to a vending machine, she would surely attract an unusual amount of attention if discovered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It would appear she saw the group of first-years and fled.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Seems like it. But if she&apos;s not here, where could she be...? Did you try her phone?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without answering my question, Morishita motioned with her chin for me to follow, crossing her arms and heading toward the side of the vending machines. Then she placed the palm of her right hand on the floor.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had no idea what she was doing, but I watched to see what would happen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hmm... She must have been sitting here until just a moment ago. It&apos;s still faintly warm.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is that so?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if she&apos;d been sitting on the floor, it seemed like it would have returned to its normal temperature in a matter of seconds, or a few dozen at most, after she stood up&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you doubt me, you should try touching it. You&apos;ll be able to indirectly feel the warmth of Yamamura Miki&apos;s butt.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a rather unpleasant way to put it, but I was curious if it was actually warm, so I touched it with the palm of my hand. Instead of warmth, a chilly sensation came through.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ugh, you actually touched it. What an outrageous pervert.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But you&apos;re the one who told me to touch it, Morishita...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, if someone told you to grope them, would you just obediently do it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No... I wouldn&apos;t...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s right. You mustn&apos;t be so easily swayed and deceived by the words of others. From now on, let&apos;s learn to judge for ourselves what&apos;s right and what&apos;s wrong. Is that clear?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She was admitting that she deceived me herself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wanted to point that out, but the bigger problem was the first-years watching me with curiosity from a distance as I was getting scolded by a petite girl.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And they probably also heard words like &apos;butt,&apos; &apos;warmth,&apos; and &apos;pervert.&apos;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a misunderstanding from beginning to end, but I probably wouldn&apos;t be given an opportunity to explain myself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In any case, we&apos;re moving. I&apos;m told Yamamura Miki moved to just outside the south entrance.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With that, she turned her phone screen toward me, showing me a message she received from Yamamura.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>[&apos;I&apos;m sorry, but please allow me to change the meeting place to just outside the south entrance. I&apos;m truly sorry.&apos;]</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It certainly seemed she received such a message, but the timestamp indicated it arrived five minutes ago.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I want to ask, just to be sure, but when did you notice this message?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I noticed it as soon as it arrived, but what of it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Five minutes ago would&apos;ve been right around when we were approaching the Keyaki Mall entrance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She indeed made a gesture as if to take out her phone... so she really did receive a message then.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So, the fact that Yamamura isn&apos;t here, and that the floor is already cold...?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes, of course. I was aware of all of it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a completely pointless trip&#x2014;or rather, a pointless act.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Now, let&apos;s hurry to the south entrance. If we keep Yamamura Miki waiting too long, her existence might just vanish from the world, you see.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Despite being the one to cause the grand delay, she turned back the way we came without showing the slightest bit of remorse.</p>",
