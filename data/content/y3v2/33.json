I must ask you to lend me your face.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The moment Mashima-sensei left the classroom, that listless voice came from the seat behind me, pulling me back to reality. Yes, just as if my hair were being forcefully pulled from behind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Tug, tug...</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Tug, tug...</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But, it wasn&apos;t &apos;as if,&apos; it was actually being pulled with considerable force.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are your ears working properly?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can hear you, so stop pulling my hair. And your choice of words is questionable.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Reluctantly, I turned around and asked what she wanted.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It appears Yamamura Miki wishes to see you now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yamamura?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">School had only just ended, but while I was gazing outside, Yamamura vanished.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She must have slipped out into the hallway in an instant, leaving behind neither sound nor presence.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And then delivered a message to Morishita.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I suppose she could have just told you herself, but for her to approach the current Ayanokouji Kiyotaka directly would make her stand out in a bad way, even with her presence being as faint as shrink wrap. Yes, I admit my magnificent metaphor may have missed the mark a little. Do you have a problem with that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I didn&apos;t say anything, though...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She played the fool, acted as her own straight man, then quietly got defensive all by herself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I intended to go to the library today for sure, but I could probably make time to see Yamamura.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">More than anything, if I missed this chance, I didn&apos;t know when she would reach out again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What should I do?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You would do well to follow me. I shall guide you. And you&apos;ll owe me for this, you know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She stood up smoothly and struck a pose with a thumbs-up, like a sidekick.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wouldn&apos;t have minded going by myself if she&apos;d just told me the location, but she unilaterally put me in her debt... Oh well, refusing would be a hassle, so I figured it was fine.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It might have been that Morishita wanted to come along as well.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I glanced around the classroom to see who was still there.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiraishi and Nishikawa were chatting with a group of a few other girls, while Hashimoto and Kitou were already gone from the classroom.</p>",
