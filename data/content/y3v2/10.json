That&apos;s the diagnosis I received.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The man stated&#xa0;in an unreadable tone, gently stroking the &apos;Matsuo Eiichirou&apos; written on the name card attached to the bed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a prolonged disturbance of consciousness. To put it simply, a vegetative state.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It meant that although he could open his eyes and breathe, he wasn&apos;t conscious and didn&apos;t recognize or react to his surroundings.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The doctor said there was a chance he could regain consciousness within a few weeks or months of its onset, but... but... that hope was slim.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m told Matsuo-kun was a very kind-hearted person.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Yes... If I... If I&apos;d noticed something was wrong with Eiichirou-kun, this wouldn&apos;t have happened, no... I never would have let something like this happen...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Full of regret and sadness, my tears flowed endlessly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You cannot survive in this world on kindness alone. No, in fact, you&apos;ll be preyed upon by fiends so wicked they are beyond salvation&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The man murmured and turned to face me, smiling.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The world works on give-and-take. You understand that, yes?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. I am grateful for your considerable support.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After visiting one hospital after another, he was the one who ultimately found a place that would accept Eiichirou.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If we&apos;d arrived even thirty minutes late, he might not have survived.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What is it you want me to do?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I have brought you an opportunity to exact your revenge.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...An opportunity...?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I will teach you how to get close to the person you should take revenge on.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Saying so, the man placed an &apos;application form&apos; and a photograph on the portable table.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What is this...?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Attending ANHS is the only way to get close to your target&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...I realize I haven&apos;t asked your name... Who are you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;My apologies. My name is Tsukishiro. I&apos;ve been well acquainted with you and Matsuo-kun sleeping here, since you were children.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve seen plenty of adults approach me, pretending to know things when they really know nothing.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is Shirogane-san doing well?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Upon hearing that name, my body reacted unconsciously, betraying my feigned composure.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He knew us since we were children.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And in an instant I understood that he was telling the truth.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So you know Shirogane-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;She took good care of me when I was young.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He looked to be about the same age as Shirogane-sensei. If that were the case, I could easily imagine that his definition of being &apos;taken care of&apos; was completely different from ours.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re not evil. But the inhabitants of the world I live in are nothing but evil, no matter where you look. They&apos;re either evil cloaked in the guise of justice, or they&apos;re simply pure evil. However, you&apos;re different, Nanase Tsubasa-san. You&apos;re ordinary, yet excellent. Ordinary, yet immature. Ordinary, yet talented. It&apos;s precisely such a person who is sometimes capable of striking down evil. This is a personal philosophy of mine, as one who lives in this world.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re Tsukishiro-san, you said. Is this boy connected to that evil?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The one in the picture was a boy who looked to be about my age.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He is Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, a key&#xa0;figure who will lead you to the target of your revenge. He has already enrolled at ANHS and is living among the general student body.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You want me to get close to him?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. I will give you instructions as needed. Everything is for the sake of accomplishing your revenge. We shall act according to the circumstances. However, be careful. That boy, though inorganic, has outstanding, refined instincts. If you approach him carelessly, he will easily see through you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then, what should I do?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You must mix lies with the truth. It is, at the very least, an undeniable fact that you care for Matsuo Eiichirou and wish to fight a battle in his name to avenge him. Therefore, you should use that as a foundation to construct a new persona and maneuver in such a way that he cannot grasp your true intentions. He will naturally be suspicious of you, but he won&apos;t delve too deeply. That is because he will recognize you as an insignificant being.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let me ask one last thing. Why me?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It is because you are in a perfect position. Neither clearly on one side, nor the other. It&apos;s precisely because it&apos;s uncertain which way you will lean&#xa0;that I&apos;ve decided you&apos;re the most suitable person for me to send.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then, what if I were to accept Ayanokouji&#x2014;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s something we can consider when the time comes.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>When he asked me if I would do it, I nodded without a pause.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Even now, I sometimes remember that exchange as if it were a dream.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>At that time, in that hospital room, my heart was at least set on revenge.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I&apos;d planned to drag out Ayanokouji Atsuomi, the one who cornered Eiichirou.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>But now, things are a little different.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I want to help Ayanokouji-senpai.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I&apos;ve come to think so from the bottom of my heart.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Because if he graduates from ANHS as he is&#xa0;now, he will go down a path of pure evil.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Victims, like Eiichirou, will end up being created by his hand.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I don&apos;t want that.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Then&#x2014;as the one who knows firsthand of that predicament, I must stop it.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>And even today, I continue to search for that small key in the deep forest...</em></p>",
