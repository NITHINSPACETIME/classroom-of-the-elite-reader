The weather&apos;s been pretty awful lately, huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The person I met up with, Karuizawa-san, murmured.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s true. The rainy season isn&apos;t supposed to start for a little while yet, though.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It rained all day last Sunday, too.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The forecast for now called for a little rain late at night, after midnight.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Thank you for coming shopping with me at this hour.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nah, not at all. I was planning to go to the supermarket myself, so don&apos;t worry about it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We both grabbed a basket and slowly walked from the fruit section near the entrance toward the vegetable section. As I picked up a golden kiwi that was on sale, I looked over at Karuizawa-san.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Did you have any particular thoughts while listening to the discussion after school today?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hmm, I dunno. Seemed like business as usual to me. Totally disorganized, everyone just says whatever they want... I mean, why are you asking for my opinion?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She replied with a wry smile, saying that it really wasn&apos;t her kind of thing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was true that Karuizawa-san wasn&apos;t normally the proactive type in serious discussions. She left most of the talking during our meetings to me, Hirata-kun, and the other more outspoken students.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We can&apos;t keep doing the same things as always. That&apos;s why I want to take a step toward changing things.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So that&apos;s why you&apos;re asking me? Well, normally, people wouldn&apos;t bother asking me for advice on an exam, since I&apos;m useless for that, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No. It&apos;s true that I reached out to you because I want things to change. But I don&apos;t think you&apos;re useless, Karuizawa-san&#x2014;unlike before.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I spoke those words honestly, prepared for her to get angry.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After all, lying and saying she&apos;d always been someone I could rely on would have been far more disrespectful to her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re really merciless, Horikita-san. But, y&apos;know, I like that about you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without so much as a grimace, Karuizawa-san laughed and accepted my true feelings.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She was far more clever of a person than I&apos;d given her credit for.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a great takeaway to have that perception corrected.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well then, how &apos;bout the &apos;super-helpful me&apos; lend an ear? So, Horikita-san, what do you think the main rule for this special exam is?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Before I could ask a question, Karuizawa-san posed one to me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I found that strangely funny and I let out a laugh myself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although I was only able to join the after-school discussion for less than an hour, several potential ideas came from my classmates.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A standard written exam, a physical fitness test.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In addition, there were oral exams, presentations, a practical music test, and interviews. There was even talk of programming, art, and drawing exams.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In any case, the prevailing view was that some kind of test would be held in one week.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The reason so many people suggested an interview exam was likely due to the major influence of our approaching entrance exams and job searches as third-years.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Considering the one-week preparation time and the lack of an explanation of the rules, that possibility certainly couldn&apos;t be ruled out.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, the opinion also came up that there was no need to hide the rules for that.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That&apos;s because if it were an interview, it would be the kind of thing they should tell us about from the start.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In any case, there were suggestions ranging from plausible to unrealistic, but none of them felt definitive yet. Since some of the ideas overlapped, we could be more efficient if we narrowed them down.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Especially for anything academic, the result would likely change drastically depending on whether it covered all subjects or just specific ones.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I told Karuizawa-san a few of my own thoughts.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She listened intently, which she should&apos;ve found boring, without showing any sign of displeasure.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And so, the conversation moved onto more sensitive topics, the kind I could only discuss with Karuizawa-san.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This is just my guess, but I think Class C and Class D are connected.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Karuizawa-san brought it up just as we were approaching the condiment aisle.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji-kun is lending Ichinose-san a hand... So that&apos;s what you&apos;re thinking, is it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah. I&apos;m sure that&apos;s how it went last time, and I think it&apos;ll be something similar this time, too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In a calm tone, Karuizawa-san answered while looking me straight in the eye.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She was the first to suggest that possibility as one of the reasons for our defeat in the last special exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, there was no proof of that for now. I&apos;d sensed something strange about Ayanokouji-kun and Ichinose-san growing closer right after his transfer, but I hadn&apos;t thought they&apos;d progressed so far as to share information with each other.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What about you, Horikita-san?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...I don&apos;t think the possibility is low. From Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s perspective, it&apos;s only natural that he wouldn&apos;t want our class, Class A, to win. Since he can&apos;t fight us directly, it&apos;s easy to understand why he would give Ichinose-san information to let her win. He knows our class better than anyone else.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While I was unable to function, Hirata-kun and the others took the lead and selected the test members. I was sure that even if Ayanokouji-kun hadn&apos;t seen it happen directly, he could&apos;ve imagined it&#x2014;what discussions took place and what conclusions they&apos;d reach.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, Hirata-kun and the others weren&apos;t at fault. I had a feeling that even if I&apos;d participated in the discussions, the outcome would&apos;ve been the same, although the process might have been different.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But this special exam isn&apos;t necessarily a one-on-one battle. It&apos;s possible Ayanokouji-kun could suffer a disadvantage by giving information to Ichinose-san.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That won&apos;t happen.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Because he thinks he won&apos;t lose even if he gives her information?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I asked that, Karuizawa-san gave a small laugh and denied it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If his goal in transferring to Class C was to raise it to Class A by himself, that&apos;s a bit half-assed, you know? He should&apos;ve just gone to the bottom-ranked Class D.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But isn&apos;t that because a leader like Ichinose-san is already there? Class C was in a situation where Sakayanagi-san had been expelled, leaving them without a new leader.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If it were Ayanokouji-kun... he would&apos;ve gone to Class D, even if it meant getting Ichinose-san expelled.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s&#x2014;that&apos;s taking it too far. He might be able to target her if there&apos;s a risk of expulsion in a special exam, but... are you saying he was trying to get Ichinose-san expelled during the year-end special exam?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That special exam wasn&apos;t one where you could intentionally get someone from the opposing class expelled. Its rules were structured around whether or not someone from within your own class would be expelled.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t think of how he&apos;d do it, but getting someone expelled isn&apos;t just limited to special exams, is it? He might even be able to do it on an ordinary day like today.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps Karuizawa-san, who dated him, held Ayanokouji-kun in higher esteem than I did. Of course, I had no intention of arguing that she was overestimating him, but...</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Assuming that&apos;s true... then why did he transfer to Class C, I wonder.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t know. But Ayanokouji-kun seems to always be thinking of something unimaginable, and he doesn&apos;t seem to need Ichinose-san&apos;s help to get to Class A. And yet, if he helped her out, I just figured he&apos;d probably do it again this time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Was this a favor intended to make future exams easier by having the lower-ranked classes join forces?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As long as his objective and the answer remained unknown, speculation was dangerous, but I had to keep it in the back of my mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And if we were going to fight based on that assumption, I had to figure out the rules of this special exam, and its solution, as quickly as possible.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A late start the next day would truly be a fatal blow.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t think I would have a sharp flash of insight so easily just because I did something different from usual.&#xa0;But I was certain that taking on new challenges like this would surely be helpful in the future.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if some might say it was too little, too late, I wanted to cherish what I realized now.</p>",
