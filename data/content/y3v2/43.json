In truth, it was completely unclear if any gap had formed at all. The students of Ryuuen&apos;s class also had an exemplary week, remaining calm and taking no action to entrap students from other classes. It seemed that the outcome would be decided by a truly trivial difference.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As I waited in the classroom that morning for my classmates to arrive, a bewildered-looking Hashimoto came hurrying in.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This is a real pain, Ayanokouji. At the eleventh hour, it&apos;s confirmed that Rokkaku&#xa0;and Yano&#xa0;will be absent.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ryuuen?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I suspected that right off the bat, too, but apparently there wasn&apos;t any real contact. They&apos;re saying they just got sick and have a fever.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">According to Hashimoto&apos;s explanation, the two of them had an idea what caused the fever; apparently, when Rokkaku and the others were shopping a few days ago, a sick-looking employee at the mall sneezed on them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From what I heard, it seemed like an unavoidable, unforeseen event.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Rokkaku and the others also understood the cause of their poor health and moreover, they hadn&apos;t done anything reckless like forcing themselves to come to school, so there was nothing to blame them for.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;d love it if today&apos;s tardiness and absences don&apos;t affect the exam... but things are never that simple, are they?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Probably.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Presumably, the scope of the exam extended right up to that morning&apos;s attendance, covering the entire week.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If that was the case, the absences might have dealt a fatal blow in such a neck-and-neck competition.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;At this point, all we can do is hope your 90% prediction is wrong, Ayanokouji, and that this exam has nothing to do with it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto pinned his hopes on the few remaining unknown rules and details of the exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a concern with this class, but make sure to tell everyone not to slander the two who are absent under any circumstances. Even if we lose because of it, it won&apos;t affect the general state of the class.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I figured you&apos;d say that, so I&apos;ve already sent out the notice.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Phone in hand, Hashimoto showed me the screen, indicating he just sent the message.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After that, the classmates who arrived in the classroom seemed to have learned of the situation; though they appeared slightly disheartened and shaken, they quickly composed themselves and went to their seats with expressions of acceptance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They understood very well that panicking wouldn&apos;t get the class points back.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Furthermore, not abandoning the hope Hashimoto had for an unrelated exam, I could see several students tackling their studies.</p>",
