class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.1.1\">Before I could say anything, though, Morishita continued: “This place is conspicuous. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.1.2\">Let’s go somewhere else.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.1\">The school. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.2\">The dormitory. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.3\">Keyaki Mall. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.4\">Where we were standing now was a place where people would pass by on their way to any of those places, so it was certainly conspicuous. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.5\">It was also an effective location for an ambush if there was someone you were looking for.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.3.1\">“Please allow me to find another location,” she said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.4.1\">Morishita immediately turned her back to me and started walking away, even though I hadn’t said anything. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.4.2\">I hadn’t intended to respond, but it was fine for her to assume, I supposed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.4.3\">It was winter vacation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.4.4\">I had time enough to enjoy unexpected encounters like this.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.1\">“Have we met?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.1\">“No. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.2\">We’ve never spoken.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.3\">Morishita answered me without even turning around. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.4\">Again, perfectly polite, but somehow overbearing. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.5\">While we were on the path leading to the dormitory, she veered off, taking one of the side roads, and came to a stop. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.6\">The deserted location, coupled with how cold it was outside, meant we were alone.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.1\">“Okay, so? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.2\">Now that we’ve changed places, what did you want to talk about?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.3\">I asked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.4\">What now? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.5\">The year was only a few days old.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.1\">“I have not yet decided,” she replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.1\">“You haven’t decided?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.2\">I was somewhat taken aback.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.1\">“I have not decided what I wish to talk to you about, but I have been wanting to speak with you for some time now, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.1\">I thought perhaps I’d misheard the first couple of times, but no. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.2\">She was calling me by my full name, and for some reason, without any honorific. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.3\">Aside from that, she spoke in a polite fashion, but her bluntness was extremely striking. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.4\">I didn’t know if she was only like this with me or if it was the same for other students as well, but I figured I’d just ignore it for the time being, since it would be difficult for me to mention.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.1\">It seemed like I was really making some strange connections with students from other classes lately.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.1\">“Is it strange? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.2\">That I called out to you?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.3\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.1\">“Well, yeah, I guess it is,” I replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.2\">“I’ve never had any previous contact with you, Morishita.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.1\">“I see.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.1\">“Moreover, when it’s coming from a person of the opposite sex, I might take it a certain way,” I added.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.1\">I deliberately decided to respond with something that suggested I was thinking her talking to me was romantic in nature, to see what kind of reaction she would give. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.2\">I thought it might make her upset or flustered, but while she showed some very slight signs of worry, she remained calm. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.3\">She immediately began to set the direction of her conversation.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.1\">“This is not the first time that I have called out to someone that I am not close to, in this way,” she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.2\">She thrust out her hand in a shoving motion as if to say, </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.1\">“Please do not get the wrong idea.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.1\">“Hm?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.1\">“I spoke with Sudou Ken the day before yesterday and with Kouenji Rokusuke yesterday,” she went on. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.2\">“I am telling you this because I have learned that it is possible for there to be misunderstandings when a man and a woman talk alone.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.1\">I was grateful for the clarification. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.2\">I wasn’t the only person she addressed this way. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.3\">Although, the mention of Sudou’s name matched up with a certain conversation that I just had earlier.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.1\">“Some girl in our grade was askin’ me a ton of weird questions ’n’ stuff.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.1\">That’s what Sudou had said, bewildered. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.2\">This was probably her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.3\">I certainly felt that she was cute in terms of physical appearance, but I could also understand why Sudou had denied that there was anything romantic involved. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.4\">The way she looked at me lacked any trace of romantic intent.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.25.1\">“Over this winter vacation, I wanted to ask about your class,” Morishita said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.25.2\">“I was driven by that desire.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.1\">I suppose if I were to put that in simpler terms, that meant she was scouting out a rival class, then? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.2\">That sort of thing? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.3\">She seemed incredibly straightforward, however, so I had no idea how to judge the situation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.4\">It was hard to imagine that she was acting on orders from Sakayanagi. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.5\">If Sakayanagi were to send someone to approach students from other classes, like Sudou, there wouldn’t be any merit in deliberately assigning the task to someone like Morishita, who, to me, appeared to be something of an eccentric.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.1\">Or was it that someone quirky like this was disarming? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.2\">I considered this and that, but I arrived at a different conclusion: this came from Morishita’s own judgment, her own independent thoughts. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.3\">As far as conclusions that I could draw right now, that seemed to be the closest to being right.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.1\">“Kouenji Rokusuke already asked me this as well, so I will tell you. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.2\">I am doing this all at my own discretion,” added Morishita. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.3\">So that ruled out my speculation.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.1\">“I see,” I said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.2\">For the time being, I would trust what Morishita said and proceed with the conversation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.3\">“I thought Class A was full of students who only acted based on Sakayanagi’s orders.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.1\">“I do not know about that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.2\">I do not share my thoughts with others,” said Morishita. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.3\">An odd way to phrase it, I thought. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.4\">She continued. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.5\">“Just as your class, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, has been rising in the ranks and watching Class A, vigilantly looking for an opportunity, it is certainly true that many of us in Class A are wary of Class B as well. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.6\">It was within this context that I became interested.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.1\">“It’s true that Class B’s reputation has improved considerably, yeah,” I agreed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.2\">“But if you want to find more detailed information, wouldn’t you be better off contacting our leader, Horikita? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.3\">I can give you her contact information if you need it.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.1\">I took out my phone, but Morishita rejected my offer with a wave of her hand and began speaking once more, staring into the middle distance. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.2\">I couldn’t tell where, exactly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.3\">“I thought so too, recently. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.4\">However, the people around me are evaluating you differently. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.5\">There are some who say that you have something to do with Class B’s rise. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.6\">A student who deviates from their OAA scores stands out that much more.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.33.1\">So that was why she wanted to speak to me?</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.1\">That was one of the significant things about the special exam that had been held at the end of our second semester, since the accuracy of our answers on the test was made available publicly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.2\">I had been attracting new attention from highly capable students, such as Sanada and this Morishita girl. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.3\">When you compared my accomplishments to my OAA scores, the glaring discrepancy was obvious. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.4\">Even if I were to tell people that I had gotten correct answers as the result of random guessing, they would likely disbelieve me.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.1\">This meeting felt too careless, too sloppy to be Sakayanagi’s orders. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.2\">It wouldn’t lead to any answers Sakayanagi would care about.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.1\">“So? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.2\">Does it seem like you’ve gotten any results by coming to me directly? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.3\">Is there anything I should answer?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.4\">I asked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.5\">I tried to demonstrate an attitude that showed I welcomed questions, but even so, she rejected the offer with a wave of her hand again.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.1\">“I have indeed gathered some,” she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.2\">“It appears that you, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, are a considerable threat after all.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.1\">“…Was there anything that made you think so?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.1\">“My own subjective analysis, yes.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.2\">Morishita nodded in satisfaction. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.3\">I was getting the impression she was quite the oddball. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.4\">“If you will please excuse me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.5\">I still have quite a few people left to investigate.” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.1\">It sounded like there were many people of interest in Horikita’s class.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.1\">“I see. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.2\">Well, good luck with that,” I replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.1\">I figured she must have been like this with Sudou and the others, too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.2\">Even though I hadn’t been there to see it happen, I could very easily picture how it must have looked. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.1\">Morishita headed back toward the dormitory. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.2\">It would’ve been a hassle to follow her and easy to provoke a misunderstanding if I had. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.3\">I decided to take in the frigid air for a while and give myself some time before heading back myself.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Chapter_Header\"><span><span

</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.49.1\">I immediately reached for the books that I had brought back with me, holding them in my cold hands. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.50.1\">Which to read first?</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.51.1\">I thought about it for a little while, but I figured the book I received from Hiyori would probably be the topic of conversation when I showed up at the library next, perhaps as soon as tomorrow. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.51.2\">So I decided to start with Hiyori’s gift. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.1\">The book wasn’t especially old—released about fifteen years ago. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.2\">I was curious as to the reason Hiyori liked it, so I tried looking up the author’s bibliography, but it seemed like he was just one of many authors who were all but unknown. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.3\">He did have a fervent, if very small, fan base, though. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.4\">Perhaps it was precisely because Hiyori was a book lover that this book might be some sort of hidden masterpiece she’d discovered. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.5\">So much so that she even purchased it several times over just to have copies on hand. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.6\">From the looks of it, the author released a new book once every three years or so. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.7\">I thought that if maybe this book suited my taste, then I’d try reading another one of his works sometime.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.1\">“Hmm…?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.1\">Just as I was about to start reading, I noticed that there was a bookmark already inserted between the pages. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.2\">That in itself wasn’t a big deal, but what caught my attention was the pattern on the bookmark. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.3\">When shopping at Keyaki Mall, you could sometimes receive a free bookmark as part of a promotional campaign, but depending on the time of year, the bookmark might feature a special, limited-edition illustration or pattern.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.1\">The bookmark I held in my hand was adorned with Christmas imagery: a fir tree and snow. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.2\">It was the same one that came with some books that I had bought at the bookstore before Christmas. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.3\">The bookmarks had changed after Christmas, so she must have bought this then. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.4\">If she’d walked around this whole time with it until we’d run into each other, I felt badly about it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.5\">She must have downplayed how long she’d had it, out of consideration for my feelings.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.56.1\">“It must have been important to her,” I mused.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.1\">Of course, I couldn’t jump to conclusions. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.2\">She might have simply given it to me as a fellow book lover. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.3\">I figured I wouldn’t think too deeply about it now, but it only felt natural to consider it momentarily, to think about how someone had you on their mind. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.4\">I wondered what I could do now to show my thanks. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.5\">And I wondered what would be good to do for Hiyori. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.58.1\">Before starting on the book, I decided to think about that as I sat down on my bed.</span></span></p>\n</div></div>",
