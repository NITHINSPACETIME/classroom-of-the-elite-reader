class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.1.1\">“Yes! </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.1.2\">Yeah!” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.1\">Kei’s birthday was March 8th. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.2\">If everything went as it should, then that should be before our final exams were held. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.3\">Until that time, nothing would change. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.4\">I would stay by her side and protect her if she had any problems, just as I had done in the past. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.5\">That was the arrangement: parasite and host. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.6\">Kei put on the necklace and then somewhat shyly wrapped herself around my arm again.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.3.1\">“It’s…been a while, hasn’t it,” she said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.4.1\">“Yes, it has. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.4.2\">Where to?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.1\">“Anywhere is fine. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.2\">As long as I’m with you, Kiyotaka, anywhere is fine.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.3\">There was nothing she wished for more than that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.4\">As Kei gave me that answer, she brought her body even closer to mine. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.5\">“So, I can come to your room again, Kiyotaka? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.6\">Tonight?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.1\">“It would be difficult for me to find a reason to refuse,” I replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.1\">“How about a bath? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.2\">Can we take a bath together?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.1\">“Of course.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.1\">Kei giggled. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.2\">Her cheeks relaxed happily into a smile, and she wiped the corner of her eyes with the tip of her finger, perhaps because tears were welling up again.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.1\">I had repaired my relationship with my girlfriend. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.2\">A joyful thing to do. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.3\">Why didn’t my heart tremor even in the slightest? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.4\">Shouldn’t I have been delighted, shaking, rejoicing together with her? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.5\">I didn’t understand.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.1\">“I’m glad we made up,” I said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.1\">Just lies. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.2\">Kei was pleased and happy with those words. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.3\">But there was no sadness in me over not understanding. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.4\">If I didn’t understand, then I could just repeat things over and over until I did. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.5\">If Kei was no good, I could test things out with another person. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.6\">If I repeatedly went out with and broke up with people in this way, there would come a time when I would learn about love.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.1\">I might find myself abandoned, distressed, reduced to tears. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.2\">Desire welled up. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.3\">I was spurred on by my inquisitive mind, which was bottomless in its appetite. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.4\">That was what it meant not to know. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.5\">There was still infinite room for learning. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.6\">For the time being, I should think only about building a relationship with Kei, just as I had been before.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.1\">“It’s been a long time since I’ve been to karaoke. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.2\">How about that?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.3\">I asked, suddenly making a suggestion so as not to let the conversation sink into a silence she might find uneasy.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.1\">“Huh, wow, Kiyotaka. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.2\">It’s unusual for you to suggest something like karaoke, isn’t it?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.1\">I could agree that yes, it might be unusual, just as Kei said, Although I did actually go to karaoke relatively often, I rarely ever wanted to sing without prompting. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.2\">“I guess it’s because I’ve been hearing some popular hits playing on the TV more and more often lately,” I said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.1\">Kei was a good partner for me to verify whether my singing quality was good enough to avoid embarrassing myself in front of peers at a later date. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.2\">She raised her hand with a smile, as if to indicate she was in favor of my suggestion, and the two of us started walking. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.3\">While on the way there, the vending machines in the rest area caught my eye. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.4\">I wondered if Yamamura might be sitting between the vending machines again today.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.1\">“What’s up…?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.2\">Kei tilted her head in puzzlement, following my gaze over to the vending machines. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.3\">“You thirsty?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.1\">“No, that’s not it.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.1\">I wondered what Sakayanagi had said to Yamamura after she gave her report. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.2\">Had she been relieved of her role? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.3\">Or was she assigned to watch someone else—someone not related to Ryuuen?</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.1\">“Oh, yeah, that reminds me,” said Kei. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.2\">“Can I talk to Maya-chan for a sec?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.1\">I told her that was fine and had her sit down on a nearby bench so as not to text while walking.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.1\">“Gonna sit next to me?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.2\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.1\">“Actually, I think I’ll check out the vending machines,” I replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.2\">“There might be a new product there.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.25.1\">“Okay.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.1\">Kei started texting with Satou, her bouncing happily in place. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.2\">I assumed that she was probably reporting to Satou that we successfully made up, thanking her once again, and so on. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.3\">Meanwhile, I decided to walk over to the vending machines in the back. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.4\">While I didn’t necessarily think she’d be there, I thought I’d look, just in case. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.5\">And sure enough, when I took a casual peek between the vending machines…</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.1\">“?!”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.1\">Lo and behold, there she was. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.2\">She was sitting the same way as before, even holding a plastic bottle in one hand like before, too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.3\">The only difference from last time was that there was a reusable shopping bag placed on the floor, which had something in it.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.1\">“We meet again,” I said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.2\">“Are you always here?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.1\">“No, not always…” But Yamamura averted her eyes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.2\">So perhaps she was.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.1\">“What’s that?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.1\">“Huh? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.2\">Oh, this? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.3\">This is… It’s a hand towel that I bought as a reward for myself.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.33.1\">“A reward?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.1\">“…Please don’t pay me any mind. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.2\">More importantly, it sounds like you and Karuizawa-san have made up.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.1\">“You heard?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.1\">“That’s what I’m good at,” said Yamamura. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.2\">She was being vague about her eavesdropping skill. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.3\">“I think you’d best leave quickly,” she added. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.4\">“I know you told Karuizawa-san that you were looking at a new product, she’ll probably figure out something’s strange if she thinks about it.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.1\">Apparently, Yamamura had even picked up on the entire contents of my conversation with Kei. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.2\">Genuinely rather brilliant. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.3\">I wanted to hear what Sakayanagi’s reaction had been, but I figured that she probably wouldn’t give me the answer to that question so easily, since it concerned the internal affairs of her class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.4\">I’d just bother her all the more by asking, so I preferred not to.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.1\">“See you,” I replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.1\">“…Yeah. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.2\">Later,” sad Yamamura.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.1\">I walked away from a scene that would have looked like I was talking to a vending machine, to an outside observer. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.2\">When I returned to the bench, it looked like Kei had just finished her conversation with Satou. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.3\">It had been the right choice to return quickly.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.1\">“Anything there?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.2\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.1\">“Nah, nothing in particular. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.2\">Want to get going?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.1\">“Yeah!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.2\">An energetic Kei got up and once again drew close, crossing arms with me.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.1\">Kei was back in good spirits, so much so that it was almost unbelievable. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.2\">Actually, no, it felt like her degree of dependency had increased. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.3\">She wanted to eat, bathe, and sleep with me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.4\">She laced her fingers between mine, very forward about her desire to not let me go, even for a moment. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.1\">The parasite burrowed deeper and deeper. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.2\">She couldn’t remove herself on her own. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.3\">She pressed forward, no fear of being absorbed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.4\">And thus, before the year was out, Kei and I had established an even stronger relationship than before, welcoming the new year as lovers.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.46.1\">The image of a certain someone—someone else—humming a tune, back turning to face other friends, was still etched into my memory. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Chapter_Header\"><span><span

</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.1\">on your day off. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.2\">Going with friends, going with a significant other, or going alone. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.3\">The only recreation options available to us during our lives here at this school were packed into this facility. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.4\">The mall certainly kept us entertained, and we never truly tired of it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.5\">However, students were prone to spend their Private Points there as a result. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.6\">It would be more efficient if students silently went back and forth only between the dormitory and the gym (despite its monthly fee), but that wasn’t the case. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.1\">The battle against temptation continued, whether it was going out to eat with someone, going out to karaoke, or absently reaching for an alluring product. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.2\">That was precisely why I wanted to spend my time without spending Private Points. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.3\">I could shut myself away in my room, but that was something I only wanted to do when I was in trouble. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.4\">As I thought about it, I realized there wasn’t much left to do.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.1\">Wearing my school uniform for the first time in ten days, I left the dormitory. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.2\">I was headed for someplace inside the school, during winter vacation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.3\">My destination was the library. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.4\">Shortly before winter vacation, I saw a certain person’s back for just a moment when I headed over to the bookstore. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.5\">Remembering that was what made me decide to go to the library. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.6\">I didn’t know whether she would be visiting the library at this present moment, though.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.1\">Although the school had been closed for the first three days of the New Year, it had just re-opened starting today, January 4th. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.2\">Though it was still early, not even 11:00 a.m., I wasn’t the only person headed to school. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.3\">There were other students there, giving their all to their club activities. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.4\">As I stepped inside the school building, I could hear the energetic voices of students coming from all around. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.5\">While on my way to the library, I happened upon Sakagami-sensei. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.6\">I couldn’t just ignore him as I walked past, so I gave him a slight bow and a polite New Year’s greeting.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.56.1\">“A very Happy New Year to you,” I said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.1\">“Yeah, Happy New Year.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.2\">Sakagami-sensei greeted me in return, though he looked to be somewhat uncomfortable around me, someone who wasn’t involved in any club activities. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.3\">I was about to continue past him, but he called out to me from behind, stopping me in my tracks.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.58.1\">“It seems you’ve been making quite a lot of progress lately in your Academic Ability score,” he said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.58.2\">“Sudou-kun’s growth is especially magnificent, but you’ve grown too.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.59.1\">“The truth is that Sudou has been putting in quite a lot of effort,” I replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.60.1\">“An incredible rate of growth, actually,” Sakagami-sensei agreed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.60.2\">“It’s unbelievable, considering how he was constantly causing problems when he just started here. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.60.3\">He’s become the school’s pride and joy, even among the faculty.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.1\">That was excellent. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.2\">I supposed that Sudou was constantly attracting the attention of the teachers because of how prominent his negative features were. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.3\">Why were we talking about this, though?</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.62.1\">“You’ve gone from Class D to Class B, eh? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.62.2\">And now Class A is within reach,” added Sakagami-sensei, lightly touching the frame of his glasses.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.63.1\">The vibe that I was getting from him was different from when I first knew him as the homeroom teacher for Ryuuen’s class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.63.2\">His behavior, the kind of worminess others found loathsome, seemed toned down compared to before. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.63.3\">He’d certainly mellowed since our time on the uninhabited island over the summer, but…</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.64.1\">Perhaps it was because Chabashira-sensei, Mashima-sensei, and Hoshinomiya-sensei were colleagues all teaching in my grade level, but I’d talked to all of them an awful lot. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.64.2\">By contrast, I had little contact with Sakagami-sensei. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.64.3\">I wondered if it was just that my impression of him changed because of how long it’d been since we’d spoken.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.1\">“To be honest, I didn’t think that your class would grow this much.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.2\">Words of praise from Sakagami-sensei, but it was very backhanded. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.3\">His gaze sharpened behind the lens of his glasses. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.4\">“You’re behind whipping up that defective class into shape, aren’t you?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.5\">he asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.1\">“Heavens, no. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.2\">I haven’t done anything of note. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.3\">I think we’ve all pulled together behind Horikita. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.4\">Don’t you?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.5\">Though I denied the assertion with a response that smacked heavily of modesty, I wasn’t certain if Sakagami-sensei bought it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.6\">Three of the homeroom instructors in my grade level knew to some extent that I was a student of special circumstance. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.7\">It would make sense if they’d shared this knowledge with Sakagami-sensei. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.8\">Even if they hadn’t, it wouldn’t be strange if he’d figured something out.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.1\">“It certainly is true that Sudou-kun’s attitude, his dedication to his studies, the results he has achieved, and so on, are things that couldn’t have been forced upon him,” Sakagami-sensei said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.2\">“Well, never mind, I suppose. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.3\">Individual ability aside, if your class really is gaining strength, then the day will come when you’ll need to cooperate with them in the not-too-distant future. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.4\">Even if you don’t want to.” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.1\">I figured that by that, what he meant was,</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.69.1\">“Show me what you’ve got.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.1\">“Are you headed to the library?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.2\">he asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.71.1\">“That’s an excellent guess,” I replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.72.1\">“Students who aren’t in clubs have limited choices this time of year, after all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.72.2\">Besides, I already know that you’re a student who makes frequent visits to the library.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.73.1\">If I were pressed on it, I’d say I was a frequent library-goer, but I had no idea that Sakagami-sensei knew it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.73.2\">I didn’t think I had seen Sakagami-sensei in the library even once. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.73.3\">He must have heard it secondhand.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.1\">“Can teachers view a student’s checkout history?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.75.1\">“Checkout history? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.75.2\">Only the librarians can do that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.75.3\">If a teacher were to do that without permission, it would be an invasion of privacy.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.76.1\">“Then how did you know I visit the library?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.77.1\">“Well, I—that may be something you can find out by going to the library. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.77.2\">Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a faculty meeting.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.1\">Sakagami-sensei dodged the question and walked away. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.2\">I found the way he phrased his answer to be curious, but since I couldn’t stop a teacher who was in a hurry, I decided to head to the library as planned. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.3\">When I opened the door to the library and stepped inside, I was enveloped in stillness.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.1\">The library was a place that was supposed to be quiet by nature, but this was different from the silence of a building full of quiet people. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.2\">There was a complete lack of sound, with no one in sight. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.3\">There wasn’t even any sign of a receptionist, either. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.4\">Perhaps the librarian had stepped away.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.80.1\">The library was unlocked, so I didn’t think that entering would be a problem, but I did feel a little awkward about it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.80.2\">I thought that I might just wait by the entrance for a while, but I figured the librarian would probably come back soon. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.80.3\">I decided to give a slight bow to the empty space where no one sat, for some reason or another, then went around and looked at the books. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.80.4\">At the moment, it wasn’t like I was thinking “</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.81.1\">What do I want to read?”</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.82.1\"> or </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.83.1\">“What should I check out?”</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.1\">or anything. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.2\">I was just casually browsing, thinking that I’d just go around and pick up whatever, and if something felt right, I’d go with that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.3\">That was about it.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.1\">As I was rummaging around to see what I wanted to check out, I heard a voice come from the other side of the bookshelf.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.86.1\">“A Happy New Year to you, Ayanokouji-kun.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.87.1\">I walked around to the end of the aisle to see who it was. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.87.2\">Apparently, the other person had the same idea, going around on the other side. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.87.3\">We passed each other and ended up on opposite sides. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.87.4\">I caught a glimpse of the person’s side profile for a moment. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.87.5\">The other person soon realized that we ended up switching places and came back over.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.88.1\">“We wound up changing places, huh?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.89.1\">“Guess so,” I answered.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.90.1\">It was none other than Shiina Hiyori, whom I hadn’t seen for quite a while after talking to her a little during the school festival. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.90.2\">She was a true bookworm, someone who visited the library quite often, but she had stopped showing up to the library temporarily. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.90.3\">I had heard that she had recently gone back to how she was before, and apparently, it was true.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.91.1\">I returned her greeting. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.91.2\">“Happy New Year. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.91.3\">It’s been a while since we saw each other in the library.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.92.1\">“Yes, it has. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.92.2\">Anything new with you?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.92.3\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.93.1\">“Same old. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.93.2\">And you?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.94.1\">“I caught a slight cold near the end of the year. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.94.2\">Luckily, it wasn’t the flu that was going around, though, so I was back to normal in about two days.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.95.1\">We proceeded to casually give each other updates on our recent goings on, and before long the topic of conversation turned to books.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.1\">“Well, since we’re both here, and if it’s not too much trouble, could you give me a recommendation on what book to check out?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.97.1\">“Really, are you sure? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.97.2\">I’d be happy to.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.97.3\">Hiyori must not have gotten the chance to choose books for other people to read very often, because she eagerly accepted my request.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.98.1\">“Well, that’s because I know perfectly well that your choice of book would be the right one, Hiyori,” I said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.1\">“Well then, please allow me to be your guide.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.2\">Far from feeling annoyed by my one-sided request, she seemed rather happy, bringing her hands together. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.3\">“Getting right to it, what genre are you in the mood for?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.1\">“Good question. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.2\">We’ve been on holiday for a while, and I’ve been spacing out a lot, so I think something with a little mystery, to get my mind going, might be good.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.1\">“Mystery, hm…”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.1\">Hiyori walked on ahead as though beckoning me to come along, without appearing especially bothered at all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.2\">Apparently, that genre was something she had extensive knowledge about. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.3\">As we were walking through the library together, she must have quickly spotted a book, because she pulled one from the shelf and asked me about it.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.103.1\">“Have you read </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.1\">The Glass Key</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.105.1\">?”</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.106.1\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.107.1\">Dashiell Hammett, huh? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.107.2\">That book was a masterpiece, chosen as one of the top one hundred best mystery novels of all time.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.108.1\">“Unfortunately, I already read it a couple of years ago,” I replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.1\">“That’s not unfortunate at all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.2\">I’m impressed, I should have expected as much. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.3\">The search continues, then.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.110.1\">With that, Hiyori continued, recommending a few great mystery novels of yesteryear, starting with the famous ones and then going more obscure.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.111.1\">“By the way…this has nothing to do with mystery ­novels, but… Have you read any works written by the author Kaminai Tsushi?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.111.2\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.112.1\">“Kaminai Tsushi? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.112.2\">I don’t know that name, so I probably haven’t read any of their works.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.113.1\">I was relatively familiar with literature, but of course I didn’t know every author. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.113.2\">I did remember authors if I’d read their books, though.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.114.1\">“That’s understandable. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.114.2\">He’s not well-known and his books haven’t sold well.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.114.3\">She said that with a smile, as though she found it somewhat amusing. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.114.4\">I thought maybe she was going to recommend one of his works to me as well, but she must have been satisfied confirming I hadn’t heard of him, because she went back to talking about mystery novels without a transition.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.115.1\">“Have you read </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.116.1\">The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.1\">? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.2\">It’s the debut work of Fergus Hume.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.1\">“I haven’t, no.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.1\">“Well then, it doesn’t appear to be checked out right now, so that might be the perfect choice.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.1\">I picked out three books with Hiyori, including the aforementioned </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.121.1\">The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.122.1\">, and then we strolled to the reception desk and found that the librarian had returned. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.122.2\">After exchanging New Year’s greetings, the librarian checked us out with efficiency, clearly well-practiced in the routine.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.123.1\">“Well then, Ayanokouji-kun, please come and visit again, if you’d like,” said Hiyori.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.124.1\">“I think I’ll probably stop in a couple times before we get to our third year,” I said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.124.2\">“Are you going to stick around in the library for a while yet, Hiyori?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.1\">“Yes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.2\">Even though we have a lot of days off, I’m running out of things to do.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.1\">“What about going to Keyaki Mall with your friends?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.127.1\">“I don’t really do that sort of thing very much,” she replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.128.1\">Thinking back on it now, I suddenly realized I didn’t recall ever seeing Hiyori hanging out with friends at school. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.128.2\">Of course, I did see her engaged in activities with her classmates, but… Perhaps she had fewer friends than I’d thought. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.128.3\">It seemed like a lot of the students in Ryuuen’s class weren’t exactly lovers of the arts. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.129.1\">Hiyori waved me goodbye, and even went through the trouble of closing the library door after I left.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.130.1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Chapter_Header\"><span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.131.1\">6.2</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-weight: bold; font-size: 2.40em; letter-spacing: 0.60mm;\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.1\">S</span></span><span style=\" font-size: 0.80em;\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.134.1\">HORTLY AFTER</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.1\"> I stepped out into the hallway though, Hiyori came chasing after me in a hurry. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.2\">Although it was only a short distance, she was slightly out of breath.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.1\">“Here—” After catching her breath, Hiyori held out a paper bag to me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.2\">Judging from the shape, I could infer that it was a book, but it probably wasn’t something from the library. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.3\">She removed the book from the bag with her slender fingers and offered it to me once more. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.4\">“This is my favorite book. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.5\">If you’d like, I was wondering if you might read it.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.1\">There was a slip covering up the book, but I had some idea what it was.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.138.1\">“Is this a book by the author you asked me about earlier, by any chance?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.138.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.1\">“Oh, you figured it out?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.2\">A book by an obscure author who didn’t have anything to do with the genre we were talking about. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.3\">Seemed obvious. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.4\">“I figured that, if you had read it, I wouldn’t be able to just hand it over to you as a gift.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.140.1\">I supposed if she wanted to give me a book as a gift, she would want to check if I’d read it first.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.141.1\">“If there’s something you just want to read, you can always borrow it from the library,” she said, “but I like to have my own copies of books that resonate with me.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.1\">“So, you went out of your way to purchase it with your own money?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.1\">“Well, yes, but also… This book is not available in the library, either.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.144.1\">Even if she wanted to borrow it, she couldn’t. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.144.2\">I suppose she could have asked the librarian to add it to the collection, but I could tell from looking at Hiyori that this book wasn’t popular. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.144.3\">While she might personally like it, maybe she didn’t feel like singing its praises to everyone.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.145.1\">“You sure?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.145.2\">I asked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.145.3\">“About letting me have it, I mean.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.146.1\">Sure, it was just one book, but it wasn’t a pocket-sized paperback that a student could purchase on the cheap.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Normal\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.147.1\">“Yes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.147.2\">To tell you the truth, it’s the third copy I’ve bought. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.147.3\">The first copy I bought while I was in junior high, and I still have it in my room, even now. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.147.4\">The second copy I bought shortly after coming to this school.”</span></span></p>\n</div></div>",
