  "content": "<h2 class=\"heading_2\">Part 3</h2><hr/><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">AT 11:00 A.M., as supplies appeared, the restricted area simultaneously expanded and an announcement was made that in one hour, the available area would become an 81-square, nine-by-nine grid from D4 to L12.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The supplies were located in a total of eleven spots: D4, D8, D10, E6, F6, G7, H10, I12, J5, K10 and L10. It seemed some were in places that were extremely difficult to retrieve, or just barely reachable and the more difficult the supply crate, the higher the proportion of them contained food.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;They&apos;re really testing us... but J5 and K10? That&apos;s just asking too much.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto let out a wry smile and waved his hands back and forth as if to say it was impossible.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From our current position, it seemed best to focus solely on moving toward the center during the 11:00 a.m. event.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s a shame we can&apos;t retrieve the food, but it can&apos;t be helped.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Before I could say anything, Kanzaki said as much, having apparently reached the same conclusion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s right. I want to avoid the risk of pushing ourselves unnecessarily, losing stamina, or getting injured. The greatest strength of the allied classes is our numbers. To avoid pointlessly whittling them down, ignoring the treacherous routes is the correct choice.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We were short on many things, but it was time for patience.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;However, I want to send a few people ahead to secure the food at H10.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was highly likely they wouldn&apos;t make it by walking, but if they maintained a light jog, they could just barely get there.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if he&apos;d already mentally prepared himself, Hashimoto gave a stretch.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well then, guess I&apos;ll step up. I&apos;ll make a run for it and see if I can secure them. Takemoto should be ready to go, too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;To prevent them from narrowing down our VIP, we&apos;ll assign several mobile guards from our class. Besides, there&apos;s no guarantee that Class B won&apos;t try to come at us with tactics to stop individuals.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With that, Kanzaki called over several male students and told them about the plan.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The classmates watched the backs of the group that departed immediately.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let&apos;s follow after them at a reasonable pace.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To prepare for when and how the restricted area might expand next, both classes first began to advance toward the area from H10 to H12.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For a while after that, a period of time began where, just as we had for the past two days, we exchanged messages with the VIP every five minutes and kept a constant watch on the movements of the other classes. The possibility that Class B might aim for H12 wasn&apos;t zero, but perhaps judging it too difficult due to the distance, it seemed they decided to focus on gathering supplies in the western area, where they could be secured reliably.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Just as you predicted, it doesn&apos;t seem like Ryuuen is making a move to attack either side yet.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah. But going on the offensive isn&apos;t necessarily a bad move.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh, is that so?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s simply a matter of the priority of fighting changing depending on what you prioritize. If closing the gap with those above is the most important thing, then the best move is to attack Class A right now and defeat their three VIPs. Alternatively, quickly securing G8 and forcing Class A to take a detour, like over the mountain, could also be interesting.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, as long as they beat Horikita&apos;s group, losing to us once isn&apos;t a big deal for them, huh.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The reason Ryuuen wasn&apos;t moving was either because he prioritized beating the allied classes over victory against Class A, or because he determined that was the choice that would lead to his own victory.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps it was a strong indication of his will to avoid the risk of engagement to the utmost limit and conserve his stamina.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And before long, a report came in from the commander to our VIP that the supplies had been secured.</p>",
