We&apos;re ready to move whenever, wherever.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">An hour had passed since the exam began. With ten o&apos;clock just a few dozen seconds away, the first event that would finally set everyone into motion was about to start.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The map was divided into areas, one square at a time, from A1 to O15 and an event would occur in one of those areas.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As it was the very first event, we would need to start by getting a feel for things, grasping the scale and details. What we knew beforehand was that events wouldn&apos;t occur in the three areas where the commanders and teachers were gathered&#x2014;E14, F13 and F14&#x2014;or in any area that was entirely ocean. This was clearly stated in the rulebook.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With Shiraishi and her radio at his side, Hashimoto spread out the map.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sanada, our analyst, also waited for the signal on his tablet, ready for anything.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And then&#x2014;the scheduled time arrived.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It looks like there are ten events in total for the first round. I&apos;ll read out the locations first. B7, D14, E5, G7, G13, H9, J12, L14, M4&#x2014;and finally, N7.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As Sanada read them off precisely, Hashimoto marked them on the map. Two other students who were on standby immediately jotted them down on their own maps by hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Each event would be active for one hour from now. If we were even a second late, the revealed password would become invalid, which meant the places we could go were inevitably limited.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The one we can get to right away is G13, right next to us. After that, D14 looks like a safe bet. Based on distance alone, we could probably reach H9 and J12 within the hour, but Class A and Class B have a huge advantage for H9...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The supplies at H9 are food, right? If it&apos;s within our reach, we&apos;d want to get our hands on it...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While it was a question of whether we could even get there in time, the top two classes were close enough to reach it in ten or fifteen minutes. Even if we got lucky and made it, the supply crate would probably be empty by then.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s like pullin&apos; someone else&apos;s chestnuts outta the fire, y&apos;know? Worst case, it&apos;ll be a three-way shootout. No, wait, if Class A and B fight it out, maybe we could hit &apos;em from behind?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto touched his chin with his fingertips and ran the tip of his pen over the map, simulating the movements.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But now that our numbers were halved, launching an attack came with a huge risk.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For what it&apos;s worth, if I were the leader of Class A, I would abandon H9, at the very least. If they were to rush over just because it&apos;s the closest, it&apos;s plain to see they would be attacked from behind by the aggressive Class B.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Morishita joined the conversation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sanada, who was still looking at his tablet, also offered his opinion on the matter.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In that case, couldn&apos;t they split their class in two and form a defensive line? Even Class B wouldn&apos;t charge in so easily if they knew they were walking into an ambush&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I wonder about that. It seems more likely they would take advantage of their current momentum and initiate an attack. Rather than taking such a risk, since they went to the trouble of being the first to break into the northern area, collecting G7 and heading for E5 would be the safe and certain option.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Abandoning the nearby food supplies would be frustrating, but that did seem to be the most sensible route.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I couldn&apos;t imagine Horikita would want to get into a fierce battle with Class B right away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From what I heard from our commander via Shiraishi, abandoning H9 without a second thought was the right call.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;ll start by securing G13 and D14 for sure.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s more straightforward, yeah.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">G13 was ammunition and D14 was daily necessities.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We decided to postpone the food problem until the start of the next event.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The main unit will move to G13 and we&apos;ll form a separate detachment with four people to escort our VIP, Takemoto. Only the VIP can receive their exact coordinates from the commander, after all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If an analyst wasn&apos;t going to accompany them, it would also be crucial to relay those details to the commander.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Coordination was essential to accurately align the location of the supplies with our own.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah... The watch only tells you if you&apos;re in the current area or not.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For now, there were no signs of other classes around D14, so it was free, but the event&apos;s location was still just <em>somewhere</em>&#xa0;in the area and without a tablet, we would have to search for it on foot. In other words, if the search proved difficult, we would waste time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To maximize our chances of acquiring the supplies, the VIP&apos;s presence was indispensable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re gonna coordinate closely with the commander and bring back those supplies.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Five people in total? Couldn&apos;t Takemoto go alone?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Just getting there wouldn&apos;t be a problem, but no matter how safe D14 is, I want to avoid a situation where we can&apos;t find the event location, or the supplies are too much to carry back all at once.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah, right, gotta think about carrying it all back, too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After opening it with the password, could we still take things out after the hour was up, or could we just take everything out and leave it there? Since those points were unclear, we had to prevent any mistakes we could.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then again, if we sent too many people, it would just force them to move around and needlessly drain their stamina.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The balance of it would likely change depending on the conditions of the supply crate.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Five people is plenty. Besides, if there are no enemies, I don&apos;t think there&apos;ll be any trouble. Leave it to me. By the way, should we just come back here to regroup?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah. The base is an easy landmark, so F13 is fine. We&apos;ll need to grab the supplies at G13 quickly while also keeping watch from F12 or G12 to see if Class B heads south.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If we moved on D14 with a large group, there was a chance Ryuuen would send a large number of his guards toward our base.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If that happened, we would be driven into a dead end with no escape.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As we immediately started preparing to depart, I spotted Yamamura with an anxious look on her face.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What is it? If you have a problem, I&apos;ll hear you out.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah, no... it&apos;s not that... it&apos;s just...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Just?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s just... it&apos;s scary, isn&apos;t it? If I get separated, I won&apos;t have any idea where my allies are or where the enemy is, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps her imagination was stirred by listening to the exchange between the VIP and the commander.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Because Class C lost Nishikawa right after the start, their situation was equivalent to having already lost one-third of their mobility. It was no wonder she felt anxious over such a trivial matter.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And there&apos;s nothing I can do to be of use...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s not true. Our class was half-decimated due to my poor judgment, but at least we still have half of us left. As long as half of us are still here, it means there&apos;s still a chance to win. If you, Yamamura, can just stay in for even one second longer without getting out, that alone is useful.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is that... really all it takes?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s what&apos;s important. Even if you can&apos;t shoot, as long as you don&apos;t get shot, that alone is a huge plus for the class. You should remember that the value is the same.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The point was to keep remaining until the very end, even if more classmates were eliminated from that point on.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After thinking for a moment, Yamamura gave a small, but definite nod.</p>",
