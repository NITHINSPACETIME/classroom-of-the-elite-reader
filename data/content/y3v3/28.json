Even though their numbers decreased, Class C, unable to secure supplies, was in the same state of deficiency.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was an adjustment intended by the school.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They were clearly being guided toward a gradual decline, tempted to launch an attack.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But the students were no fools. They weighed the risks of combat against the contents of the supplies and chose to endure hunger rather than lose their VIP or escorts. At least, that&apos;s how it went on the first day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">So, what would happen on the second day? It all depended on the addition of new restricted areas and their scope.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If the usable area for Class C, currently holed up near their base, were forcibly narrowed, they might finally resolve to cut off their escape routes and fight for real.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve got him cornered... but how&apos;re you gonna move, Ayanokouji?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">One thing was certain: Ryuuen had no intention of remaining on the defensive.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ideally, he wanted to launch an all-out attack on Class C, even by force and sink them to last place.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He judged that no matter if Ayanokouji was there, they had a 99% chance of winning right now.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, that came with the precondition that the special exam would end at that very moment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After defeating Class C, it would be extremely difficult to defeat Class A and Class D with their remaining forces.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There&apos;s always the option of crushin&apos; that eyesore Class A first... but that&apos;d just make the guys at the bottom happy.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If it turned into a war of attrition between two classes, the remaining two would simply profit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Quite an early morning, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sensing a presence, Katsuragi came outside and called out to Ryuuen as he approached.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you deliberating on which class to target?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At those words from Katsuragi, who sensed his boiling blood up close, Ryuuen gave a small laugh.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Something like that. Well, the main target&apos;s always Class C.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Being belligerent is all well and good, but even if we don&apos;t force an attack, time, coupled with a lack of supplies and the restricted areas, will inevitably force a fight. Is there really a need to squander the advantage we gained from the surprise attack on Class C at this stage?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sure, maintainin&apos; our numbers advantage ain&apos;t a bad thing. We&apos;re the ones holdin&apos; the initiative here. But we already used our main tactic yesterday to get the first strike. Since they still have the right to use theirs, it means they can launch a surprise attack too. Striking before that happens is one option. And if he decides he can&apos;t fight and uses tactics to escape, well, that ain&apos;t half bad for us either.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then Ryuuen looked at the supplies placed in front of the tent and continued.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;When you&apos;re hungry, your stamina drops whether you like it or not. It&apos;s frustrating that we won&apos;t be able to use the strength of those idiots.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There were many big eaters in Class B, but for that reason, they still had plenty of stamina for now.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The more time passed, the more their advantage would fade, Ryuuen explained.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi folded his arms, mulling over Ryuuen&apos;s words.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He understood his intent and it wasn&apos;t as if it lacked reason.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...You have a point. If we use the supplies we desperately scraped together for breakfast, we&apos;ll have almost nothing left. That said, having them continue to collect supplies on an empty stomach is problematic. However, that is precisely why I believe we should prioritize collecting from events on the second day as well.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi had come to that conclusion after discussing it with Ryuuen late last night.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">His opinion hadn&apos;t changed and he advised that they should basically remain on the defensive.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Only Class C should be feeling impatient. For now, we should simply keep a close eye on the other classes. That line of thinking was part of your original plan, was it not?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi knew that Ryuuen wasn&apos;t making light of the risks of attacking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Still, what he couldn&apos;t get behind was his abnormal obsession with Class C.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To be precise, he was concerned that his fixation on defeating Ayanokouji would end in futility.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s a strange thing. They should&apos;ve been half-destroyed by that surprise attack, but lookin&apos; at this map, I can&apos;t see Ayanokouji showin&apos; any sign of weakness.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen stared at the mark in the south. Katsuragi, who looked at it as well, nodded once in agreement.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s the fear of not being able to see your opponent&apos;s face. The stronger the enemy, the more one&apos;s imagination is stirred up with wild ideas of what they might do to outmaneuver you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen partly agreed with the &apos;overthinking&apos; part, but he learned that lesson the hard way over more than two years of fighting.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The plan succeeded and damage was dealt.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In other words, it meant that even Ayanokouji had an opening. However, it was a minuscule one.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The difficulty of continuing to press that opening was incomparable to the initial surprise attack.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In any case, don&apos;t overthink things with Class C. If you truly cannot suppress your urge to fight, shouldn&apos;t you turn your attention to Class A for now? We won&apos;t become Class A unless we defeat those above us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2014;Maybe so.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen looked away from the map and up at the trees, where the sun was just starting to shine through.</p>",
