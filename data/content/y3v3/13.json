Survival Game Special Exam.</a></h1><hr/><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>EARLY MORNING, LATE June.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A large cruise ship carrying students from all grade levels was crossing the open sea, heading toward a certain small, uninhabited island.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The first-years couldn&#x2019;t hide their bewilderment at the sheer scale of it all.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The second-years looked tense, but still carried an air of confidence.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Oddly enough, for us third-years, this would mark our third straight year battling it out on an uninhabited island.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no mistaking that it was looming right before our eyes, but there was one thing that&#x2019;d been unexpected.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was the fact that the stage of our battle was the exact same uninhabited island as last year.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Still, when you thought about it calmly, it actually made perfect sense.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was said that there were easily over ten thousand uninhabited islands in Japan, both large and small, but if one narrowed it down to islands where people could actually land, the number dropped significantly. Furthermore, if one looked for an uninhabited island with terrain usable for an exam and for which permission could be obtained from the owner, there would likely be only a handful available.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The beaming sun was intensely bright, but it was by no means too hot; rather, bathed in the sea breeze, it was somewhat chilly. The effect of moving the schedule up by about a month compared to last year and the year before seemed to be surprisingly significant.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The large cruise ship, advanced gently while cutting through the waves, eventually began to slow down to be embraced by the shores of the uninhabited island.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The time was just past eight in the morning.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Looks like we&apos;re finally arriving.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since we had free time until the ship arrived at the uninhabited island, Hashimoto, who&#x2019;d come to the ship&apos;s caf&#xe9; with me, muttered that while stretching and yawning.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah~, I&#x2019;m sleepy. I should&apos;ve gone to bed a little earlier yesterday.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed he stayed up late into the night and was a little sleep-deprived.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well then... I wonder what kind of troublesome, no, pain-in-the-ass exam is waiting for us this year.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Muttering that in succession, Hashimoto pinched the front collar of his brand-new short-sleeved shirt with his fingertips and lifted it up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There&apos;s probably a reason they went out of their way to distribute new gym clothes to us, too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Upon boarding this ship from the school, all of us third-years were distributed new jersey tops and bottoms as well as shirts to wear underneath. We were obliged to change into them before disembarking. In appearance, they looked almost identical to the usual ones, but compared to our regular gym clothes, the fabric seemed slightly thicker, so it was certain that there was some kind of difference.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But isn&apos;t this unbearable for students preparing for entrance exams? Being pulled away from their desks at this time of year. Have the third-years up until now never complained about this?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The words spilled from Hashimoto, who for the time being had absolutely no intention of taking entrance exams.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Who knows. But I did see Shimazaki bringing a set of study materials onto the ship.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So he&apos;s stuck studying even on the ship, huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though I also saw him get hit by terrible seasickness and give up halfway through.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In any case, won&apos;t they provide study time afterwards to make up for it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;They wouldn&apos;t cut into our precious summer vacation, would they? If that&apos;s how they &#x2018;make up for it&#x2019;, then spare me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What kind of measures were they considering, or were they not considering it at all?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As a third-year student, I was mildly curious, but right on cue, as if someone heard Hashimoto&#x2019;s grumbling, an onboard announcement came on.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&apos;We will be arriving at the uninhabited island shortly. As previously informed, third-year students are to leave all personal belongings, including mobile phones, in their guest rooms and carry nothing. Please change into the designated gym clothes and prepare to disembark.&apos;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Such was the reiterated notification. Since both Hashimoto and I already finished changing and were empty-handed, we only had to wait for the ship to stop without moving anywhere in particular.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The fact that the first and second-years haven&apos;t been called yet... does that mean, by any chance, that they won&apos;t be landing on the uninhabited island right away?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto, who assumed it would be an uninhabited island exam where all grade levels were jumbled together from the start, looked around with a puzzled expression.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe. But speculating now won&#x2019;t tell us anything.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;True...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shortly after, when the ship docked and the announcement came on stating that it&#x2019;d come to a complete stop, I stood up from my seat with Hashimoto and headed outside from the deck.</p>",
