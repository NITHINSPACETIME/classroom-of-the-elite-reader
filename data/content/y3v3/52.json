  "content": "<h1 class=\"heading_1\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"/read/y3v3/2\">Epilogue:<br/>Show Me What You&#x2019;ve Got</a></h1><hr/><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">THE WATCH, INDICATING F11 to E11, struck 3:00 p.m. and Class A, having lost three VIPs, was forced out entirely and eliminated.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as I slowly removed my finger from the trigger, Yamamura and Shiraishi, along with Kanzaki and the two VIPs from Class D, appeared before me as I quietly surveyed our surroundings. There were five of them in total.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Were the remaining guards taken out?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. We were attacked by two Class B students while we were running away... According to Ichinose-san, it seems those two had their personal GPS signals turned off, so they completely caught us by surprise. We used the tactic you gave us permission to use beforehand and escaped and thanks to you buying us time, we were saved.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiraishi reported the situation, though she was still breathing heavily.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Tell me the details.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yamamura, who was similarly out of breath, seemed unable to speak yet, so Kanzaki spread out a map instead.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The ones left in Class B are Ryuuen and Ibuki, as well as Yamashita and Yoshimoto. Their location is D11&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then there are three left. I just took down Yoshimoto there a moment ago.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed he hadn&apos;t received the latest information from the commander yet.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...It seems several signals disappeared before we got here, but was that all you, Ayanokouji-kun?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I cleaned up the area within my line of sight to a certain extent. But it seems the two troublesome ones are still left.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The ones remaining from Class C were me and the VIPs, Shiraishi Asuka and Yamamura Miki. From Class D were the guard Kanzaki and the VIPs Beppu and Himeno. In terms of points, Class B and Class C had 102 points, while Class D had 201 points.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If the exam ended now, first place would be secured and second and third place would go to a sudden death match, huh.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It seems there&apos;s no doubt that Class B&apos;s VIP is Yamashita-san. I just got a message from Shimazaki-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I figured. There&apos;s no merit whatsoever in making Ibuki the VIP.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Class A taking last place was already set, so there was no risk of expulsion, but the rankings for third place and above weren&#x2019;t decided.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The key wasn&apos;t the number of VIPs, but the number of guards.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With one hour remaining, if even one guard from any class survived, they could unilaterally decide the outcome.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Should I leave Beppu here, who still had stamina to spare, or should I leave Himeno?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you suppose their next move will be?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No matter how small the playable area has become, they&apos;ll likely stick together. As for their tactics, there&apos;s a possibility they still have one personal GPS jammer left, but with only one, they can&apos;t track our movements without a VIP, so it&apos;s not a huge problem. By the way, how much ammo do you two have?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Um, I have a full load. I... haven&apos;t fired any shots... I also have two magazines... I&apos;m sorry...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;On the contrary, I&apos;ve used up pretty much everything. Whatever&apos;s left in here, maybe 10 or 20 rounds, that&apos;s all I&apos;ve got.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then take this.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I handed Kanzaki the two magazines I had prepared as spares.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I appreciate it, but doesn&apos;t this break the rules&#x2014;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not robbery or anything. It&apos;s just a transfer.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But what about you? Do you have enough ammo?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I have 22 rounds left. That should be enough.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then I can&apos;t accept this. You should be able to use it more effectively than me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. The important thing is for the guards to protect the VIPs and escape until the very end. Besides, sometimes it&apos;s more convenient not to be carrying an excessive amount.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wouldn&apos;t be an even match if I had 100 or 200 rounds, after all.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Fighting in such a tense situation was the only way to enjoy it when the outcome was uncertain.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Now that third place or higher was guaranteed, I could cast aside any unnecessary thoughts and indulge in the survival game.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen would probably rather take down Shiraishi, Beppu and Himeno rather than confront me directly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But as time passed, the area would shrink further, forcing a confrontation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What... are you going to do?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ryuuen won&apos;t be satisfied with the exam ending like this. If he doesn&apos;t fight, he&apos;s guaranteed either second or third place, but if he fights and wins, he has a chance to seize first.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Five minutes passed and the GPS updated.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The reports that came in from both Shimazaki and Ichinose stated that all the changes on the GPS were minor.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They maintained their state of standing still in roughly the same location without using any tactics.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but Beppu, could you come with me for a bit?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What are you going to do...?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not too keen on this stalemate leading to a sudden death match. If there&apos;s no movement in the next ten minutes, I&apos;m thinking of making a move ourselves.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had Yamamura and Shiraishi, as well as Kanzaki and Himeno, stand by for the moment. I instructed them to move immediately if anything changed on the GPS, then walked forward with Beppu.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was certain they were checking the GPS data from when I charged into Class A alone on the evening or morning of the third day to identify individuals, so word of my movement would undoubtedly reach them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen wasn&apos;t stupid enough to be unable to perceive our movements and our objective.</p>",
