From their current situation, what could he do to lead the class to victory? Defeating Class A in an all-out battle before the lower-class alliance closed in on their area was the most rational and simple option. Should he make his move early on this third day&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After that, there was also the all-or-nothing strategy of using their remaining forces to target only Ayanokouji&apos;s group&apos;s VIP&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t like this one bit.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Choosing that option meant his judgment was being influenced by the hastily formed lower-class alliance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was nothing less than the side that succeeded in a surprise attack and seized the advantage being forced onto the defensive.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The feeling that he wouldn&apos;t let Ayanokouji have his way welled up inside him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If that was the case, then he could also go all out and attack the lower-class alliance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>They must be thinking that we won&apos;t make a move against an alliance that has swelled to fifty people with Class B...</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Heh, he ain&apos;t that naive.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Attacking Class A, attacking the alliance&#x2014;Ayanokouji had probably considered both.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Either way, Ayanokouji already anticipated in his mind how Ryuuen would fight.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do I want to do... No, what do I want?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Victory for Class B was a given, but there was something he craved just as much.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And that was to beat Ayanokouji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What should he choose to achieve that and be satisfied?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As he averted his gaze from the sea and turned around, he found a lone girl walking on the beach.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">All by herself, she was smiling at the gently lapping waves.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen lightly rolled up the map, stuck it in the back pocket of his gym uniform and started walking toward the person.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Lookin&apos; pretty happy all by yourself, Shiina.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh my, good morning, Ryuuen-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiina, who returned the short greeting, turned to face Ryuuen and smiled cheerfully.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Since we&apos;re at the beach, I was taking a little walk.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After answering, Shiina looked at Ryuuen&apos;s stern expression and surmised his state of mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I heard that there is a high probability that Class C and Class D have joined forces. What do you intend to do?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As Shiina walked slowly along the deserted beach, Ryuuen matched her pace and walked alongside her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There ain&apos;t nothin&apos; to it. I&apos;m gonna win this special exam and I&apos;m gonna do it with my own damn power.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen declared forcefully, as if to hide his own indecisiveness.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. We believe in your words, Ryuuen-kun and we will follow you, now and always.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Seeing Shiina smile, Ryuuen returned a slight smile of his own.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do whatever you want for the next 30 minutes or so.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen turned his back to return to the tent, but Shiina called out to him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ryuuen-kun, if the beginning of a novel you were reading was hopelessly pessimistic, what kind of ending would you imagine?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Such a question. Anyone else probably would&apos;ve scoffed and ignored her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He stopped and thought about it seriously. Then he immediately found the answer within himself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Unfortunately, I&apos;m not a fan of stories with depressin&apos; beginnings. But most stories are made to be convenient, ain&apos;t they? If that&apos;s the case, then wouldn&apos;t they usually turn out for the better?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s true. The structure of a story is such that readers are most moved when it turns from darkness to light, so works with sad starts often become the foundation for depicting rebirth, atonement and healing. Conversely, if a story begins on a bright note, a sad ending often awaits.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After replying, Shiina continued.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;However, it&apos;s a wide world out there. There are many masterpieces that are sad from beginning to end.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;re you gettin&apos; at?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That it&apos;s best to be mentally prepared for whatever might happen. Not just for this special exam, but for what lies beyond as well...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as there was a chance of victory in an exam he thought he might lose, defeat lurked in an exam he thought he could win. And, that it wouldn&apos;t necessarily always follow that rule.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So in the end, it means we don&apos;t know shit about what&apos;s comin&apos;, huh.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Fufu, perhaps that&apos;s so.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But still&#x2014;I&apos;ll force my way through with my own power. Whatever it takes to take down Ayanokouji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I believe that&apos;s for the best.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Looking into Shiina&apos;s eyes as she answered, Ryuuen gave her a sharp, testing gaze.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And that&apos;s even if I force some kinda cruel choice on you down the line?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen knew full well that it was a malicious question. That was precisely why it was a question that, ordinarily, he shouldn&apos;t have voiced.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But Shiina met his gaze without looking away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If it would be for the sake of everyone... for the sake of the Class B that is so important to me...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After she answered, Shiina gazed at Ryuuen with a smile.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In that case&#x2014;I won&apos;t hesitate. No matter who my opponent is, or what the outcome may be.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Good.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After meeting the gaze of Shiina, who answered with resolve, Ryuuen returned to the tent where Katsuragi and the others waited.</p>",
