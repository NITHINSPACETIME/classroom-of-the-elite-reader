If we carelessly get involved in the central area of H9, we might have to fight Class B... or even Class C.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She couldn&apos;t afford to be blinded by supplies whose quantity and other details were unknown, only to lose her precious classmates in the process.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hirata proposed fighting defensively without hesitation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I agree. In this special exam, losing classmates early on limits our strategic options and it&apos;s clear we&apos;ll just be worn down. We can&apos;t take a big risk for the first supply drop when we don&apos;t even know how much we&apos;ll get.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Above all, to avoid engagement, they&apos;d chosen to start from G12 when they won the right to choose in the lottery. Simply to break through to the northern area via the straightest, shortest route.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if an event happened to appear nearby, they shouldn&apos;t carelessly get involved unless it was extremely safe.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Maintaining a situation where not a single person was missing for as long as possible was the simplest and most reliable way to aim for the top ranks in the special exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They stopped to assess the situation, but Horikita soon began to move toward G7 with Hirata by her side.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Man, serves Ayanokouji right. Got his ass kicked by Ryuuen and ran back to the starting point. And one of their VIPs got taken out, right? Even if they run around, if the exam ends like this, they&apos;re guaranteed last place.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From behind her, she could hear Ike and the others laughing as they talked about it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou, who&apos;d been listening nearby, crossed his arms, nodded deeply and walked over to Horikita.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Suzune. About that fight between Class B and Class C just now. Honestly, I was surprised.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Me too. To use a tactic for an all-out attack right at the start... even if you thought of it, it would take considerable courage to execute. To be so bold when they&apos;ve barely gotten the hang of using the guns... But, it might have been one of the optimal choices, timing-wise. Right after the start, we also had moments where we were defenseless and stopped to focus on strategy. The thought that we might be surprise-attacked with a tactic... we weren&apos;t on guard for that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She confessed that she&apos;d been concentrating solely on reaching the northern area.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah. But still, for Ayanokouji to get taken down so easily...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...I suppose so.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It&apos;d been obvious that fighting Ayanokouji would make victory extremely difficult.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At the stage where everyone started on equal footing, the class she wanted to fight the least was Class C.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was because she&apos;d thought that if she attacked them carelessly, they would surely be countered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you think about him losing, Horikita-san?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hirata, walking beside her, turned his gaze to Horikita and asked.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;My honest impression is, &apos;Really? Is it possible?&apos;&#xa0;I was certainly surprised by the boldness of using a trump card at the very beginning, but I never imagined they would take such a major blow.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I feel the same way.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji-kun is&#x2014;how should I put it... He&apos;s not the type of person to be careless in this kind of fight.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was precisely why, like Sudou, her surprise was the only thing that preceded all else.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The preconceived notion that he wouldn&apos;t be defeated without a reason made it difficult for Horikita to judge the situation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a dangerous way of thinking, close to faith or worship, that Ayanokouji had no weaknesses.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But if he anticipated the preemptive strike, he shouldn&apos;t have let his class get half-wiped out. He could&apos;ve escaped quickly, or even met the attack head-on and had an even fight, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The actual result was a crushing defeat and a rout.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The number of Class C students who vanished from the GPS told the story, allowing no room for concealment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was a slight opening that Ayanokouji had shown, a clear and undeniable fact.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is there absolutely no way it&apos;s part of Ayanokouji&apos;s strategy? Like, to reduce the hassle of gathering food.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s true that with fewer people, food problems are lessened. But you could just have people retire later if you run into trouble and it would be the same thing. There&apos;s no merit in reducing your numbers from the start. What&apos;s more, even their VIP was taken out, so their efficiency at gathering supplies will also drop.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hirata&apos;s words were correct. And yet, while they were correct, she just couldn&apos;t bring herself to be convinced.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No, the feeling that she didn&apos;t <em>want</em>&#xa0;to be convinced was growing stronger.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I probably... just don&apos;t want to frankly acknowledge it. Acknowledge Ryuuen-kun, who managed to get the better of him.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She focused on creating distance, turning her back on a powerful enemy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even though she knew it was a choice made to win, there was a somewhat servile emotion to it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s all right, Hirata-kun. I won&apos;t laugh at his defeat, nor will I let my guard down. If we, or Class D, had been in Class C&apos;s position, it&apos;s highly likely we would have ended up with the same result.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Looking at the GPS signals moving away, Horikita murmured that a feeling of relief had undoubtedly come first.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But let&apos;s gratefully accept the result. The situation is now slightly in our favor.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And with their numbers down, a point gap&apos;s opened up, too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Class C, having taken heavy damage, became last place and Class B, who attacked them, also lost four guards. With that, the scores of Class A and Class B became even, so if they could make it to the end without fighting, a sudden death match would be held to decide second place. The addition of that condition wasn&apos;t bad news.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But we should probably estimate our score as one point lower. That guy Koenji could retire at any moment. It&apos;d be nice if he at least used the ammo he took to take out one person... but that&apos;s probably not gonna happen.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou snorted in a way that could be taken as either irritation or exasperation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shortly after the exam began, Koenji ignored Horikita&apos;s instructions and turned his back on them, saying he would enjoy himself by getting some exercise on the deserted island. He didn&apos;t see it as a special exam, but rather as a simple vacation. It could be easily inferred from his actions two years ago that he would return to the ship as soon as he got bored.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;As long as he doesn&apos;t get in our way, I suppose it&apos;s fine. Unfortunately, I&apos;m in no position to expect more from him at the moment.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Horikita managed to save up Private Points in her daily life, but she made a large expenditure to secure Koenji&apos;s cooperation in the last special exam. If she were to try and secure his cooperation for a long-term special exam like this one, he likely wouldn&apos;t agree for merely two or three times the amount of Private Points he had previously.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even without Koenji-kun, our situation isn&apos;t bad.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Our top priority should be to quickly head north. That will allow us to safely maintain our advantage. Let&apos;s hope that Class B and Class C continue to fight amongst themselves.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Still, I wonder why I can&apos;t feel relieved in the slightest, even though Class C is in a jam.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s true... We should be one step ahead and yet it&apos;s still frightening.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Horikita&apos;s expression tightened.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s because Ayanokouji&apos;s still in&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Horikita affirmed with a slight nod.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As long as Ayanokouji wasn&apos;t out, they absolutely couldn&apos;t afford to underestimate him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If anything, he was sure to come up with some clever trick to cancel out their mistake and make a comeback.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was precisely why they were moving to the northern area, to gain enough distance so they couldn&apos;t be taken by a surprise attack, no matter what tactics he used.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even though their numbers have been halved, I still can&apos;t help but feel this invisible pressure.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although it was clear that there were no enemies nearby at the moment, Horikita couldn&apos;t shake a lingering anxiety that they might still get attacked.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I feel the same way. In fact, precisely because they lost half their people, I&apos;m thinking they&apos;re gonna stage a comeback with some outrageous move.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ryuuen-kun probably feels the same. That&apos;s why he didn&apos;t give chase; he couldn&apos;t.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After a brief moment of hesitation, Sudou shyly placed a hand on Horikita&apos;s shoulder.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, let&apos;s just focus on what we can do. If it comes to a straight-up fight, we&apos;ll crush &apos;em, whether it&apos;s Class B, Class D... or even Ayanokouji. Right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At least Sudou was more confident in his physical stamina than anyone else.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He would fight with all his might to protect the class, no matter how much effort it took.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was prepared for that.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let&apos;s move. First, we&apos;ll head north and secure as many event locations as possible. We need to gather supplies to avoid needless conflict.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Seeing Horikita stride forward purposefully, Sudou gave a short reply and the class proceeded north.</p>",
