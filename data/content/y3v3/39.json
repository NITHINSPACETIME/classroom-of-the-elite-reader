Ryuuen laid in his tent, lost in thought as he stared at the low ceiling. When he heard footsteps nearby, a faint shadow appeared.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s past nine o&apos;clock.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At Katsuragi&apos;s quiet report, Ryuuen silently sat up and went outside his tent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The students who&apos;d been waiting for Ryuuen to emerge greeted him one after another.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He ignored them and walked over to Katsuragi, who was waiting with a map spread out.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ibuki and Ishizaki were also waiting for him with grim expressions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;From last evening to this morning, no students from Class C or Class D have been eliminated. In fact, the two classes are now clustered together, intermingled.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So they teamed up, huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I thought it was strange there were no signs of combat from the moment they made contact, but...for it to come to this.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s the only way for the nearly-annihilated Class C to survive, I guess. Heard they were making some weird contact with Ichinose, too. Means they were plannin&apos; to team up from an early stage.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Now that it&apos;d actually happened, it seemed like the best possible move for the wounded Class C to take.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yesterday&apos;s battle with Koenji was also a huge blow. Losing nine people is a considerable loss. The fact that Morofuji survived without being eliminated was a silver lining, but...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Man, I really wish he&apos;d just charged into Class C and Class D instead.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In this matter, the fault lies heavily with Komiya&apos;s group for their rash, semi-provocative actions after their paths crossed. Had they quietly let him pass, it is highly likely a conflict could have been avoided.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He said after summarizing the report from Morofuji, who desperately returned to the main force yesterday.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh, but Ryuuen-san, that Koenji guy retired just a little while ago!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Guess he&apos;s satisfied after hunting down some small fry. What a self-centered bastard.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The sacrifices were not insignificant, but it means one threat has been eliminated. That&apos;s precisely why the frustration with Komiya&apos;s group&apos;s failure is mounting, however...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But Morofuji&apos;s group <em>was</em>&#xa0;trying to contact Kaneda before they fought Koenji, weren&apos;t they?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As Ibuki interjected, Ishizaki also spoke up defensively.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Right at that moment, the Class C guys attacked to secure supplies, so the radio was tied up, right? I don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair to blame only Komiya&apos;s group. They just had bad luck.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi, to whom those words were directed, looked quietly at Ryuuen and opened his mouth.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Bad luck... was it? Do you really think so?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nah. The timing was just too damn perfect. If they were serious about stealing supplies, they should&apos;ve been able to rush over a bit sooner. Maybe they delayed a little to aim for when Komiya&apos;s group would run into Koenji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The main force and the detached unit. It was obvious which radio would be prioritized. If Ryuuen had been speaking directly with Kaneda, he could have relayed a message to Komiya&apos;s group with little time lost, but with a VIP in between, there were inevitably delays and errors in the information transmission.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You mean <em>he</em>&#xa0;planned that? If so, that&apos;s too perfect. I can&apos;t believe it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi folded his arms and once again recalled the events of yesterday.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I also believe, as Ryuuen said, that there&apos;s no doubt Ayanokouji orchestrated this, aiming for the moment Komiya&apos;s unit and Koenji would overlap. However, he likely didn&apos;t think the probability of an actual engagement was high. It is more natural to see it as him aiming for a by-product of his own attack.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If Komiya&apos;s group calmly altered their course or hid themselves, they wouldn&apos;t have ended up in a fight, judging from what Koenji said to Morofuji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen and Katsuragi had the same thought. Even if that wasn&apos;t the case, they firmly shared the understanding that their opponent was someone who&apos;d do that kind of thing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Uh, um, Ryuuen-san. About Class C and Class D becoming allies, how are they gonna decide who gets the higher rank? Wouldn&apos;t they normally not be able to agree...?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Obviously Class C&apos;s gonna compromise. No matter how you look at it, they&apos;re headed straight for last place on their own. I can just picture &apos;em, crying and begging Class D to help them out in exchange for letting them take the glory.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; Ishizaki said, striking his fist into his palm in understanding.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s the key point. The issue of ranking, which would be a source of endless dispute if they were equals, becomes a viable alliance precisely because of the difference in their positions. They&apos;ve certainly played a troublesome hand. As a result, their side has swelled to fifty people and the difference in numbers between them and us, who lost Komiya&apos;s group, now exceeds twenty. The tables have completely turned.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi explained the situation was no longer optimistic, but Ishizaki once again slapped his palm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then how &apos;bout we team up with Class A? Together we&apos;d have sixty people!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And would we, who are similarly at a numerical disadvantage, concede and give first place to Class A?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh? Uh, well, that&apos;s&#x2014;can&apos;t be helped, right? Ah, but no, that&apos;s no good...!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ordinarily, an alliance was not something easily formed. For two classes competing for the seat of Class A, not even a single class point was something they could readily compromise on.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To begin with, there was far too little merit for Class B in teaming up with Class A only to hand over first place.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no trust between them and it was uncertain if they could even form an alliance. Even if they did, there was no guarantee they could beat C and D. Rather than shouldering multiple risks like that, it was more efficient for Class B, in its aim for the top, to defeat Class A directly and secure third place or higher.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If this had been a move right at the start, we would have still had several options, but for them to form an alliance here on the third day is more troublesome than I imagined.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even the path of defeating the crucial Class A was now hampered by the difference in numbers created by the elimination of Komiya&apos;s group. It was inevitable that this would hinder their battles when the number of usable areas drastically decreased.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What will you do, Ryuuen? Today&apos;s actions may well decide the outcome of this exam.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">His judgment as leader was now being tested.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was the sole focus of Katsuragi, Ibuki and Ishizaki, all eyes were on Ryuuen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The initiative had, at some point, slipped from Ryuuen&apos;s grasp and was now passing to the opponent who should&apos;ve been at a disadvantage.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The possibility that the lower-ranked alliance would launch a preemptive strike to defeat either Class A or Class B couldn&apos;t be dismissed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Things are finally gettin&apos; interesting.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For Ryuuen, one thing was certain: there wasn&apos;t much time left.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Still, he couldn&apos;t come to a conclusion right away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Leaving word for his comrades to wait, Ryuuen turned his back on the three of them and began to walk toward the sandy beach.</p>",
