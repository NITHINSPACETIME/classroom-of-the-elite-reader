If one glanced down every five minutes as the GPS updated and watched Class C&apos;s movements as frequently as their own, their understanding of the one leading the class, Ayanokouji, would naturally become clearer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Class C, half-destroyed by Class B&apos;s surprise attack on the first day, had been forced onto the defensive yesterday and today, pinned down in the southern area near the base.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Their recent attack, an attempt to make a comeback by recovering at least one more supply cache, also ended in failure and looking only at the results, it meant they made a huge blunder twice in a row.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What did Ichinose think as she watched those events unfold?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ayanokouji&apos;s uncharacteristic carelessness and his clumsy way of fighting&#x2014;that was what left a strong impression.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&apos;It helps us out that they&apos;re fighting, but Class C is really in a bind, huh?&apos;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The voice of Kobashi, the VIP, reached Ichinose through the radio.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She then continued.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&apos;We&apos;re just going to keep our distance like we&apos;ve been doing, right?&apos;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was the safe play. All the classes would maintain their distance and concentrate only on recovering supplies.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They only needed to fight when absolutely necessary. That was the better way of thinking, the standard strategy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&apos;At this rate, Class C might just end up losing.&apos;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kobashi muttered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s not true.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&apos;Huh? No? What do you mean... not true?&apos;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ichinose smiled and sent gentle words over the radio.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji-kun won&apos;t lose. No, I won&apos;t <em>let</em>&#xa0;him lose.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having said that, she once again explained in detail the story of the alliance she made with Ayanokouji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&apos;...Does that mean we&apos;re supposed to help Class C?&apos;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without denying the question, Ichinose continued in the same tone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If we absorb Class C, we&apos;ll become the largest force. No matter how belligerent Ryuuen-kun is, he can&apos;t carelessly attack a class with over fifty people. Of course, the same can be said for Class A.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If that happened, Class A and Class B would have no choice but to crush one another. If first place became impossible, the battle would shift to one of trying to force the other into third place in order to aim for second.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I need you to tell everyone in the class properly beforehand. Ayanokouji-kun will be making contact with Class D, so when he does, make sure we absolutely do <em>not </em>attack first.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It came through even over the radio that Kobashi, who hurried off to get Kanzaki, was conveying Ichinose&apos;s words with gestures. He might have wanted to object, but there would probably be no arguments.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Judging that her class was ready to accept Class C for the time being, she quietly stood up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And then she gazed at Class C&apos;s current location.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Mhm...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ichinose hugged her tablet and her thoughts drifted to Ayanokouji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2014;I understand, Ayanokouji-kun. I know what you&apos;re thinking.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if trying to link her thoughts with his more than anyone else, her consciousness was always directed toward Ayanokouji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&apos;Kanzaki-kun wants me to ask, just to be sure, if this will really be for Class D&apos;s benefit. He seems anxious after seeing how Class C has been acting so far...&apos;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s a needless worry. Because Ayanokouji-kun is&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Quietly over the radio, Ichinose stated her thoughts.</p>",
