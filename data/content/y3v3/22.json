Ryuuen decided to immediately execute a certain strategy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a strategy to defeat Ayanokouji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In a long battle spanning four days and three nights, everyone wanted to save their tactics with strict usage limits. Everyone would first think to avoid conflict. He turned that on its head.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t simply a reckless gamble that would determine victory or defeat within the first hour.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In a way, Ryuuen considered it the most effective countermeasure against Ayanokouji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Superhuman physical abilities and intellect.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The longer the special exam dragged on, the more time it would give Ayanokouji to think.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He would come up with effective ways to use their tactics.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And he would likely read the thoughts of Ryuuen, Horikita and Ichinose completely.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In that case, it was best to strike Ayanokouji before he could devise a clear plan.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was precisely the result of his judgment bearing fruit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As Ryuuen stared at the results of the surprise attack, Katsuragi quietly approached him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve finished confirming with Kaneda through the VIP. We have three casualties and they have fifteen. Among those fifteen were our target, Kitou and the designated VIP, Nishikawa. This is undoubtedly a great success, more than we could have imagined. Furthermore, it appears Class C got separated from three of its members while fleeing and they&apos;re still wandering around this vicinity. We&apos;ll take them out if we can before our tactic expires&#x2014;I take it you have no objections?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah. If things go well, that&apos;s eighteen people. Not bad.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;However...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi, who had a slight concern, hardened his expression and continued.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kondou and Komiya chased after the fleeing Class C and haven&apos;t returned. It seems Kondou will catch up to Class C soon if he doesn&apos;t take a wrong turn, but Komiya has strayed far off course and is isolated.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was bad news received from the commander.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s probably better if Kondou doesn&apos;t catch up. I can&apos;t imagine him accomplishing anything by jumping in alone against a cautious Ayanokouji. Leave him.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then, may I send Yamashita to retrieve Komiya? If you&apos;re concerned about a girl going alone, I think we could assign a male student as an escort.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To find the stray students, a student who could coordinate with the commander was indispensable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, that&apos;s fine.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen initially agreed with Katsuragi&apos;s proposal to dispatch the minimum number of personnel.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No&#x2014;send ten people.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He immediately retracted his statement and re-instructed him to significantly increase the number of personnel.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ten people? The risk of engagement seems low, but is this for insurance? I have no objection, but it will be a needless drain on their stamina.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I almost forgot myself, but moving in a small group will just give them a hint.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...I see, that makes sense. The GPS-Jamming tactic will expire soon. When that happens, our current location will be pinpointed by the other classes all at once, is that it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s right. They&apos;ll know there&apos;s a VIP mixed in with the group we send out.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Because there was a tactic called Identify Person, which revealed the identity of a designated GPS signal, there was a risk of giving away the information that Yamashita was the VIP at a low cost, depending on their movements and timing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, if they moved as a unit of ten, the odds of identifying the VIP among them would be one in ten.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He figured that even if the movement was suspicious, the enemy would feel a strong reluctance to use Identify Person.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That may be true, but... are you sure? This will interfere with our plans for later.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;More importantly, how many bullets do we have left?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;About half, I&apos;d say. We&apos;ll definitely need to resupply at the next event, but we can still fight as planned.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even after receiving Katsuragi&apos;s report, Ryuuen&apos;s expression didn&apos;t relax; on the contrary, his vigilance only increased.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a success so great that wanting anything more could be called a luxury.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, for Ryuuen, there was a reason he couldn&apos;t rejoice wholeheartedly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Your strategy was a magnificent success and yet you don&apos;t look happy at all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as Katsuragi, wanting to know the reason, was about to ask Ryuuen for an answer, Ishizaki came running up, panting heavily.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ryuuen-san! Let&apos;s go after those Class C guys right now and finish &apos;em off! We&apos;re all set to go, sir!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if to follow Ishizaki, the students who were confident in their physical abilities gathered behind him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The second the order was given, the pursuit of Class C would begin.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2014;-No, this is as far as we go.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, Ryuuen ordered a retreat, rather than the attack they originally planned.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Huh!? Wh-what do you mean!? It went perfectly, didn&apos;t it!?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Before they launched the surprise attack, Ryuuen suggested they would press the attack if their targets fled. Since the operation was a success, Ishizaki assumed they would give chase.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi, too, showed some confusion at Ryuuen&apos;s surprisingly timid move.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you certain you don&apos;t want to pursue them? If we let Class C gain distance on us here, we might not be able to recover.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They could still close the distance with Class C. Looking ahead, where tactics like disabling the GPS would be useless and surprise attacks would be difficult, they should strike while they had the chance, Katsuragi said.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is there something on your mind?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If the ambush had been a <em>total</em>&#xa0;success, sure, I would&apos;ve been planning to hunt &apos;em down &apos;til they were wiped out.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You don&apos;t consider this outcome a success?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He held out longer than I expected.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen muttered this toward the back of Kitou, who&apos;d been taken out and was now heading back to the starting point.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It certainly took some time, but our losses were minimal.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This ain&apos;t about our losses. The problem is we failed to take down the one guy we needed to. If we&apos;d gotten Ayanokouji in the ambush, I would&apos;ve been fine with letting you and Ishizaki go and mop up the remaining small fry like you wanted. But as long as the most troublesome bastard is still standing, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if he managed to turn the tables on us even when we&apos;ve got twice the strength.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If they got greedy and pursued too far, they could be counterattacked from an advantageous position.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Or they could risk walking into some kind of trap.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Considering those factors, Ryuuen decided to call off the pursuit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;W-well, it&apos;s true Ayanokouji&apos;s a monster, sir, but this ain&apos;t a fistfight. With this thing, even <em>I</em>&#xa0;might be able to take him down.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Saying so, Ishizaki raised the shotgun he was holding.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe, if we were to surround him or chase him into a corner with no escape.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen&apos;s gaze fell on the deep forest where Ayanokouji and the other Class C students fled.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Visibility was even worse there than here and the footing was poor.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And large trees grew thick enough for them to regroup and hide themselves.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Besides, if the other three classes aside from Class C chose to avoid conflict, Ayanokouji&apos;s class would be guaranteed to finish in last place.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Now that one of their VIPs is down, Ayanokouji has no choice but to go on the offensive, like it or not. So there&apos;s no need for us to jump the gun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After hearing this, Katsuragi processed Ryuuen&apos;s decision to retreat in his own way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t say the thought that you&apos;re being overly cautious with Ayanokouji hasn&apos;t crossed my mind... but if we&apos;re speaking from a position of maximum vigilance, then perhaps pulling back here is the best move. Just having our ambush succeed is a victory in itself. It&apos;s an undeniable fact that we&apos;ve blunted Class C&apos;s opening gambit. And the fact that we&apos;ve proven even Ayanokouji has openings we can exploit is also a major gain.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Exactly.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In reality, what Ryuuen gained from this surprise attack wasn&apos;t just taking out half of Class C, including Kitou and a VIP.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What was more significant was that not even Ayanokouji was infallible. If Ayanokouji were omnipotent, he would&apos;ve been able to foresee the ambush, quickly distance himself from Class B and escape.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The fact that even the most formidable opponent had a slight opening to exploit was a great relief to Ryuuen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Very well, then. Let us assemble a ten-person search party, including the VIP Yamashita and send them out without delay.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi called Nomura over, told her what they just discussed and had her take action immediately.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although some of the students, like Ishizaki, who were still excited from their victory, felt somewhat unsatisfied, they swallowed their feelings and accepted the decision, as it came from none other than Ryuuen.</p>",
