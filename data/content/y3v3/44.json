They were only organizing small groups to collect supplies, just like us. Meanwhile, Class A, as if chased by the restricted area, had fled south and was about to reach G7.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If they continued on, their final destination would either be there or they would advance as far as G8.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Either way, it seemed that area would be their goal for the day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Finally, we closed the distance to the point where we could reach the enemy&apos;s base in a matter of minutes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, it was time to change course.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It looks like we should make an adjustment.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;An adjustment?... What do you mean by that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was true that events had taken a turn I hadn&apos;t anticipated, but in that case, all I had to do was restore the balance from my end.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kanzaki! Come here a sec!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as we arrived in H10 and were taking a break, Watanabe waved his hand and shouted.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I knew at once that something happened, so I, being nearby, headed over to Watanabe with Kanzaki. There, lying in the shade of a tree, was the figure of Ninomiya, breathing heavily.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Amikura, who was anxiously by her side, looked at us while placing a hand on her forehead.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;She hasn&apos;t been feeling well since this morning... I think she&apos;s started running a fever. I think she&apos;s at her limit.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ninomiya had her eyes slightly open, but she seemed unable to even pretend she was all right for our sake. She would occasionally cough, her expression twisting in pain.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;She should retire immediately and have the school come pick her up.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kanzaki nodded when I said that and Norihito immediately ran off to the VIP.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A few students have been coughing since this morning. It&apos;s possible we might have a few more students retire between tonight and tomorrow.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I couldn&apos;t rule out the possibility that it wasn&apos;t just a matter of poor health, but that some kind of cold was spreading.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even though we were outdoors, the students had been constantly moving around in close proximity for the past three days.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I reiterated that there was no need to push themselves.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was likely also an effect of having shared the food we obtained with Class C, who hadn&apos;t been able to secure much, to support them. A lack of nutrition could disrupt the autonomic nervous system too, leading to a weakened immune system, making it easier to become ill.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry to bother you while you&apos;re busy, but today&apos;s final event is about to start.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I left Kanzaki in charge of the situation and returned with Hashimoto to where Shiraishi and Sanada were.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When 5:00 p.m. came, the analyst&apos;s tablet was updated.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As soon as the screen lit up, Hashimoto let out an involuntary whistle. An announcement was made that the restricted areas would increase again and it was decided that the survivable area would shrink to a six-by-six grid from D7 to I12.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Since the area&apos;s gettin&apos; smaller, the number of supply drops is down to eight. Looks like we&apos;re gonna be sleepin&apos; on emptier stomachs tonight than yesterday. The only ones we can grab nearby are in G9 and H12 or so&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ll go to G9. Takemoto... and about six others, lend me a hand.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I called over Moriyama, who was passing by and asked him to gather more people, telling them we were going to retrieve supplies.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re goin&apos; too, Ayanokouji? You can just save your strength for the final day, y&apos;know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, there&apos;s something I want to do. I&apos;ll explain the details to Takemoto&#xa0;on the way, so have Shimazaki fill you in.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;O-Oh, got it. Be careful out there.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I told the members to get ready to leave in three minutes and I began my own preparations.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A weapon, one bottle of water and portable rations. I also took a one-person tent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After that, I took Takemoto, Moriyama and the others and hurried to the northern part of G9.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We found the supply crate right away and inside were seven single-serving meals. Of course, for an alliance of just under fifty people, it was a drop in the bucket, but even that was very much appreciated.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I looked at my watch and saw that it was about to be 5:25 p.m.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had Takemoto check the status of Class A and Class B and found that Class A had finished collecting supplies and was about to enter area G8. Class B&apos;s situation hadn&apos;t changed since morning.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s already evening, but it&apos;s pretty scary with them just a stone&apos;s throw away. Let&apos;s hurry back.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Moriyama said that and I and Takemoto followed his lead, beginning our swift return to H10.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After walking for about ten minutes, I called out to Takemoto.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Class A is moving as planned. Contact the commander now and tell them to disable my personal GPS the moment the next GPS update occurs.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This is what you were talking about earlier... Are you really going to do it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, I&apos;m not coming back today. You remember the plan for after you return to the main group, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...I know. I&apos;ve properly shared with Shimazaki what to do if you get taken out, or if you don&apos;t. Don&apos;t worry.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Takemoto nodded, though he still looked somewhat uneasy. Moriyama gently put his hand on his shoulder.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Leave it to me until we get back. I&apos;ll make sure he gets there safely.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He gave a thumbs-up, so I returned the gesture.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Well then&#x2014;there wasn&apos;t much time left until 6:00 p.m., so I decided it was time to really hurry.</p>",
