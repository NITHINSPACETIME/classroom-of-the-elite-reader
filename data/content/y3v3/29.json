That was because all GPS information had remained frozen from 6:00 PM to 9:00 AM, the hours outside the exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That said, students had to restart the next day from the area they were in at 6:00 PM the previous day, so there was no need to worry excessively unless an enemy remained in the same area.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It seems the GPS locations have been updated. Not a single one is missing and their movements appear to have been minimal within the same areas. Koenji-kun, who&apos;s isolated from Class A, is also still present and is said to be in D6.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&apos;d expected that someone might report feeling unwell overnight, but it seemed everyone managed to get through it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I knew he crossed mountains and rivers in a day, but he&apos;s completely enjoyin&apos; himself, ain&apos;t he? He can&apos;t have any extra food, so what the hell&apos;s he doin&apos;? Don&apos;t tell me he&apos;s livin&apos; off the land?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wasn&apos;t an expert on the wild plants of the uninhabited island, but I hadn&apos;t seen enough of them to supplement one&apos;s nutrition. One could catch fish in the sea, but there were no fishing rods among the supplied items this time. That meant it had to be something one could find on the beach, but judging from his movements yesterday, his GPS hadn&apos;t reached the sea.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, whatever. He can&apos;t get any extra supplies without the password anyway, so we can just leave him be.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was unclear whether he would become a threat, but it was certain there was zero merit in us getting involved.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Koenji, huh&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I hoped he would&apos;ve voluntarily retired during the off-hours, but he was still there?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is something the matter? I believe it would be best to leave him alone, as Hashimoto-kun said.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s our common understanding, but there&apos;s just a certain... creepiness to it. It&apos;s because I don&apos;t understand the reason why he&apos;s still here instead of retiring.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re the one who thinks he&apos;s not motivated, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s more accurate to say that&apos;s how I saw him. That&apos;s why I expected him to have already retired by this morning. I also considered the possibility he might approach the base by nightfall.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Koenji&apos;s current position was quite far from the base, deep within the uninhabited island.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He probably just thinks it&apos;s a vacation, right? That&apos;s his character, after all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This place is the same as last year. There shouldn&apos;t be anything new about it for Koenji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Follow Horikita and participate in the special exam...?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No, of course I wouldn&apos;t say the probability was zero, but it still wasn&apos;t very high.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My own thoughts, from having analyzed the student known as Koenji Rokusuke.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Isn&apos;t it a waste of time just thinkin&apos; about it? Even if, by some chance, the guy is motivated, we have no way of knowin&apos;. He&apos;s alone and as long as we don&apos;t make contact, there&apos;s no problem, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Unable to contact his commander, Koenji didn&apos;t know the location of his allies or his enemies, so even if he had the will to fight, it was true he couldn&apos;t find an enemy on his own.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In other words, the idea that there would be no problem as long as we kept track of his GPS location was fundamentally correct.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, there was the unavoidable case of accidentally running into him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Or, even if he had no intention now, there was also the case that Horikita might plot to make him move in the future.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was important not to dismiss him as just one person and to always keep an eye on him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s everyone&apos;s condition?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Can&apos;t say we&apos;re in top form, not by a long shot. To be honest, I&apos;m hungry too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The food we secured yesterday. If we were to use it all up, we could fill our stomachs temporarily, but looking ahead to today and tomorrow, we had to refrain from wasteful consumption.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Unless the other classes make any suspicious moves, our basic strategy is to wait until an event occurs.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I conveyed our tentative policy and spoke once more to Shiraishi and Takemoto, telling them to maintain close communication between the commander and the VIPs.</p>",
