As a result of a combination of my daughter’s preschool being closed due to current circumstances in the world, my wife not being in the best of health for an extended period of time, and the birth of our second child, I had to prioritize supporting my family over writing for a time. Thanks to everyone’s efforts, my family has now grown and things have begun to settle down somewhat, so I have started to devote more time to writing again. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Also, it’s precisely because we’re in the midst of such challenging times right now that I’ve realized once again that I must not forget that there are people who really look forward to these works as a source of entertainment. I hope to make up for the delay in the release of this volume at some point in the future. For the time being, I&#160;humbly ask that you please be patient.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Okay, so anyway…yeah. Syougo Kinugasa here. Are you doing all right, everyone? I am a total mess right now. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Seriously, because of everything I’ve been through, I&#160;am utterly exhausted. I’ve got a lot of stuff I’ve got to vent about. Usually when I have a lot of free time on my hands, I feel like I get totally disheartened and discouraged about writing, but this time, I experienced the total opposite. “LET ME WRITE!!!” I was shouting that from the depths of my heart. When you don’t have the time to do so, you truly realize just how grateful you are to be able to work.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Well, there are a lot of depressing events going on in the world right now, but I think there are some small things that have happened that weren’t all bad. Since people haven’t been going out and have been encouraged to stay at home, many restaurants have started selling bento boxes to go. This has given me a chance to experience flavors from restaurants that I normally used to just pass right by. When businesses are back to running like normal, there are definitely a few restaurants that I’m going to visit.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Anyhow, this particular volume, which is the second volume of the year two arc, is on sale now. It acts as a prelude to the story in volumes three and beyond. It was basically my idea to try to write about one special exam per each book, but I can’t really say that’s the case this time around. Students from each grade level are fighting hard to achieve victory. That alone makes the story much&#160;longer. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">This volume, more than any before it, really has that “To be continued” feeling. So, in that sense, I think I’d really like to get the next volume out as soon as possible. I&#160;think I’d like to get…two more books out before the end of the year. Can I do it? Or not…? Anyway, please pay attention to that kind of stuff sometimes too. You can’t get your hopes up too high though, okay? ☆</span></p>\n",
