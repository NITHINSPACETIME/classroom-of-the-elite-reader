But before that, I needed to learn everything and settle things within myself. I called that man on my phone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was late at night, but I was certain the call would connect.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Tsukishiro, answer me. Why did Naoe give up his position to follow Kijima?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You say such interesting things the moment I receive your call.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You should know everything, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Until now, Naoe-sensei had prided himself on being the best politician. However, he realized that Kijima-sensei was someone who would surpass him.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ridiculous.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Although they have pretty different ideals, they surprisingly have a lot in common.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And&#x2026; you think that would convince me?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The existence of the White Room you were involved in isn&apos;t something Kijima-sensei would be pleased with.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What are you talking about? That man has ANHS. It can also be launched as a second political measure.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Indeed, that&apos;s one of his flagship political strategies. However, at the same time, he had been quietly advancing a new plan that&apos;s similar to the White Room. In other words, the second measure has already started moving. Coming forward with the plan prematurely isn&apos;t desirable for him.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;So, that&apos;s why Naoe cut me off&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s unclear at which point, but the White Room had reached Kijima-sensei&apos;s ears. He had discussions with Naoe-sensei, and as one of the conditions for putting a stop to the project, you could say that Naoe-sensei made Kijima-sensei promise him a future position.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kijima&#xa0;was also considering a plan similar to the White Room, huh?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s not all. You were far more capable than Naoe-sensei had imagined. In recent years, he relied on you a lot, but at the same time, didn&apos;t you think there were a lot of unreasonable demands?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Yes.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s because he was afraid of you. Eventually, he hoped you would fail rather than continue using you. However, you didn&apos;t fail. Well, it&apos;s not like you never failed, but you managed well, erased traces of your failures, and kept a low profile. That alone is a considerable skill. Naoe-sensei wasn&apos;t raising you to be at the top. He hoped that when his son becomes the country&apos;s leader, you would support him as his right-hand man. Naoe-sensei&apos;s only miscalculation, despite being someone who could see through anything, was your boundless ambition&#x2014;he failed to perceive it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In another ten years, even Naoe wouldn&apos;t be able to completely crush me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He took action to prevent that in advance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whether&#xa0;it was a parting gift to his son or a bomb for me, who might threaten his son.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you satisfied with the answer?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why are you speaking so openly?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you were the type of person who would meet their downfall here, I wouldn&apos;t have spoken. However, my intuition tells me otherwise. Eventually, you&apos;ll return to the public stage, stronger than ever. That&apos;s why I spoke.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What a smart decision. But of course, you plan to smoothly maneuver through things no matter how things turn out, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A foolish question.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This man wouldn&apos;t commit solely to me. He could become an ally or an enemy to anyone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If deemed incompetent, he would discard me in an instant.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You can sell my information to Naoe or anyone you like. In return, I will get information from you. It&apos;s preferable for both sides to keep each other under surveillance.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Understood.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It looks like we&apos;re going to have a long relationship, Tsukishiro.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I hope so. Please contact me anytime you have a request, Ayanokouji-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With that, Tsukishiro hung up the phone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Yes, that&apos;s right&#x2014;I&apos;m not finished here.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>From now on, I will thoroughly fortify myself and accumulate power to protect my own life.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>And at the same time, I will create soldiers in the White Room.<sup id=\"fnref-1-17b59044-7c73-5dba-b138-e0527b9415c9\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-17b59044-7c73-5dba-b138-e0527b9415c9\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup></em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><em>&#x2022;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Located in the middle of a luxury, top-class high-rise hotel in Tokyo, two hundred meters tall with fifty stories above the ground, was a banquet floor. I arrived a little before the scheduled time and was lost in thought in the ascending elevator.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a three-hour rental, serving food to about sixty people, costing about three million yen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It might&apos;ve seemed trivial, but considering the bleak financial outlook, it wasn&apos;t cheap.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The party had been growing in scale every year since the facility started operating.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had to solicit more donations than ever before.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Naoe&apos;s influence had turned many wealthy backers against me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From two hundred to sixty, it was clear from the decrease of supporters.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Money, I need billions of yen.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Today, all I needed here was my own skill.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My reflection in the giant elevator&apos;s fully glass sides met my eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I&apos;ve aged quite a bit.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Looking back, I was able to calmly reflect on my aging.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a miracle that I had been continuing to operate the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>But I&apos;m still halfway through the journey</em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It had been a while since I was expelled from the political world, but the fire of ambition within me was burning brighter than ever.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I arrived at the designated floor and stepped out of the elevator into the waiting room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having lost the politician title, I was now treated as a former politician.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Normally, my influence would&apos;ve decreased significantly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, my title as the head of the White Room operation was steadily gaining power.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Otherwise, the financiers wouldn&apos;t gather here.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji-sensei, it&apos;s almost time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although I had many thoughts, solving the financial issues was my top priority.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The larger the scale, the more enormous the maintenance costs for operating the White Room became.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In order to sustain it, I had to transform disposable money into productive investment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You seem restless. How many times have you gone to the bathroom now?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Tabuchi, who had returned to the waiting room, sat down in his chair and began to nervously tap his left foot up and down.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;When will you get rid of that nervous habit?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but I can&apos;t help feeling anxious about missing this chance&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, if funds ran short, the White Room project would hit a significant snag.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It&apos;d be best if it were merely a temporary freeze, but stopping the children&apos;s education would be a fatal blow.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It would be like the chicks we had raised dying from a pathogen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Listen, Tabuchi. We can&apos;t ignore the fact that there&apos;s no way out. However, that&apos;s exactly why we have to take a bold step forward without looking back. Think about what you&apos;d do if we fall&#xa0;only after we&apos;ve fallen.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As the speed of his trembling left foot slowed, Tabuchi looked up at me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re strong, Ayanokouji-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Considering the crises I&apos;ve faced before, this is nothing. I was exploited by Naoe, the White Room Project was ordered to be suspended, and I lost my title as a politician.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yet, I never stopped walking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I prided myself on having walked a path of hell that I couldn&apos;t tell others about.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Aside from people like Naoe and Kijima, it wasn&apos;t easy for mere politicians to even meet me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although I had lost my politician title, there was no doubt that I had surpassed my former self.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Eventually, Tabuchi&apos;s trembling stopped, and he clenched his fist firmly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had to show those who believed in and followed the White Room that they wouldn&apos;t regret it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do you think we can succeed today?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course. Do you know what the most powerful weapon that anybody can easily use is?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;What is it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s a &apos;lie.&apos; Of course, it&apos;s a double-edged sword that comes with risks. However, a lie has power.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A&#x2026; lie?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Politics is a world where some have risen to the top with just one lie. That&apos;s how powerful a lie can be.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, a lie only had meaning if it was skillfully managed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;ll make full use of that weapon. Let&apos;s go, Tabuchi. This is the White Room&apos;s moment of truth.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes, Sir!&quot;</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"17b59044-7c73-5dba-b138-e0527b9415c9\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-17b59044-7c73-5dba-b138-e0527b9415c9\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-17b59044-7c73-5dba-b138-e0527b9415c9\">[1]: </a>A time skip occurs after this</p></li></ol>",
