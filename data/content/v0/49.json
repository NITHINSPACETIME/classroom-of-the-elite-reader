Officially, he had recovered and returned to the political world, but in reality, his life was hanging by a thread.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The proof was in his sabotage of the White Room and Naoe&apos;s&#xa0;relentless pressure toward his shadow supporters. He had decided that he would eliminate me before his own life ended, and I had just received the perfect time to prepare for it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, the temporary suspension of the White Room was a setback, but I was ready to launch a counterattack.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;ve grown old, Naoe.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My battle in the political world was about to restart soon.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>The signs and premonitions&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if to bless me, Kamogawa appeared, whom I hadn&apos;t seen since that day at the <em>ryotei</em>&#xa0;with Naoe.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s been a long time, Ayanokouji-sensei. I didn&apos;t expect you to come to meet me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s just a coincidence. Don&apos;t concern yourself over it. How are things on your end?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although I had been communicating with him by phone, my opportunities to meet him face-to-face had decreased even more than with Sakayanagi in recent years. Any careless action could get caught in Naoe&apos;s surveillance network.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Thanks to you, I&apos;m managing somehow. How about you, Sensei?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re the one who keeps getting elected. You should be the one called &apos;Sensei.&apos;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I joked with him, but Kamogawa responded with a very serious expression.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Indeed, you aren&apos;t a politician now, Ayanokouji-sensei. However, you&apos;ve brought many of the wealthy under your wing, and you lead the well-known educational institution, the White Room. The rumors about you never cease.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, I had survived through tough times.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though ousted from the political world, I now had a path I could never have imagined, starting from the White Room and incorporating many business people into my assets.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I no longer held the title of a politician, but more people called me &quot;Sensei&quot; than before.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In the White Room, I&apos;ve heard that your son is quite outstanding.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is that sarcasm? It&apos;s because I went too far that it got temporarily shut down.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa chuckled, but his gaze was unchanged.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No, he seemed to have grown even more than before.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;As you may have guessed, Naoe-sensei is pulling the strings behind the scenes. I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll make the White Room widely known to avoid getting hit himself, but he&apos;s started using every trick in the book to erase it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If it weren&apos;t his idea, it would&apos;ve been crushed long ago. It seems quite difficult for him too. What&apos;s his next move?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So far, it&apos;s unclear. I&apos;m hanging onto Naoe-sensei&apos;s faction, but since I once worked beside you, I&apos;m not trusted.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if I tried to force an investigation, it would be difficult to bypass Naoe&apos;s defense network.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was more important to keep someone hidden from within.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But&#x2026; lately, it seems his health has deteriorated quite a bit.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Speaking in a hushed voice, Kamogawa muttered his words next to me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s frustrating that I can&apos;t bury him with my own hands, but having him buried by illness might be best.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That showed just how formidable Naoe was as a man who showed no openings in the political world.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Given his age, his time was likely coming soon.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji-sensei, your comeback is near, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. That being said, even if he disappears, the difficulty it&apos;ll take to reach the top of the political world won&apos;t change. No, it will probably be much harder than before.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s true. Naoe-sensei was a major figure in politics, but Kijima, the person who has control over him, might be even more formidable.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If things went smoothly, the day to break the record was near&#x2014;the record for the longest tenure in office.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even at his age, still in his sixties, the Kijima&apos;s era could continue for another ten or twenty years. And I, who was once a novice, was steadily aging.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This might be the last chance to strike.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s why we need to make sure the timing is right when we go for the kill.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The White Room&apos;s temporary freeze.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whether it would last six months or five years, the duration was uncertain at the moment. However, the biggest problem for us was if it became public. However, Naoe likely shared the same concern.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They must be devising strategies to bury it from the shadows and into the shadows.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The car that had been arranged arrived, and Tabuchi opened the rear seat door.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa also slowly got into the passenger seat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Tabuchi, how are the arrangements?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;As planned, the children are temporarily being supervised and managed at the orphanage we purchased.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Your son&#x2014;is it really okay?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I have no intention of favoring him just because he&apos;s my son. However, as long as he remains the White Room&apos;s greatest masterpiece, there&apos;s no doubt that he has the &apos;qualifications.&apos; It&apos;s enough to make me hesitate. This is meaningful in its own way.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We headed to our destination by car and decided to wait for Kiyotaka, who was being brought out from the clinic.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even so, a counseling clinic&#x2026; Has something happened to Kiyotaka-kun?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No. The reason I sent him here is because there was someone who desperately wanted to meet Kiyotaka. It&apos;s a request from a person who&apos;s provided significant funding, so it can&apos;t be helped.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;They want to meet him?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s a shallow idea. They intend it as a way to heal wounds, but they don&apos;t know it&apos;s counterproductive.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ishida, who had come out of the clinic ahead of us, joined in.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kamogawa, when was the last time you saw Kiyotaka?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let&apos;s see, it&apos;s been about five, no, six years since I last saw your son. I&apos;m really looking forward to seeing how much he&apos;s grown.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Looking forward to it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as Ishida finished getting in, he glared at Kamogawa with a puzzled expression.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh, did I say something strange?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He&apos;s a monster. You shouldn&apos;t look at him with such a frivolous attitude.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A monster&#x2026;? But he&apos;s your son, Sensei, There has to be a better way to say it&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter. Ishida has also been watching over Kiyotaka since he was born.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was allowed to put it in any way he liked.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, he had more of a right than someone like me, who&apos;s only related to him by blood.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">His development as a human was trained to a level unimaginable for someone about to enter their third year of middle school. However, there were also more than a few things that he lacked as a result.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was also one of the reasons why Ishida called him a monster.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At Ishida&apos;s tense words, Kamogawa furrowed his brows&#xa0;and turned his gaze out the window.</p>",
