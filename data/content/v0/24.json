I arrived earlier than scheduled.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sakayanagi, bowing politely, approached with his usual smile.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I was looking forward to the White Room&apos;s unveiling today.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That seems to be the case.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Over the past three years, I continued to strengthen my ties with Sakayanagi.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I thought we were incompatible due to his privileged upbringing&#x2014;well, in fact, we probably didn&apos;t get along. However, even so, people can become unpredictable when a common goal is present.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps because I had dealt with people always probing for ulterior motives, meeting with Sakayanagi, who had no hidden agendas, had become a relief rather than a pain.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Still, I was surprised by the security. It doesn&apos;t seem to fit this place.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It can&apos;t be helped. We can&apos;t make this public right now. There are countless people desperately searching for scandals involving me and Naoe-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sakayanagi just gave a wry smile, perhaps troubled by my response.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You were the one who helped with the White Room project the most. I wanted to show it to you first.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I just wanted to support this project since more children would be saved.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sakayanagi firmly believed that these children would carry Japan&apos;s future.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For Naoe-sensei and me, it was merely a card used to promote ourselves, but that idea had already been taken into consideration.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whatever his motives, if this plan saved children, he would approve.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was an incorrigibly good person, but because of that, it was hard to tell when he might&apos;ve&#xa0;become an enemy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If he were to realize that the children&apos;s futures weren&apos;t guaranteed, he would distance himself from me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let me guide you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Please do.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I first led Sakayanagi to the laboratory.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Today is an important day to decide on a new policy for the White Room, and I want you to see the children&apos;s growth.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The children we took in are already over three years old, aren&apos;t they? Time sure flies.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sakayanagi, being a collaborator, also saw some of the children.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He must&apos;ve recalled several past scenarios.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Aren&apos;t you going to have children?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I met Sakayanagi, he already had a partner he had been with for several years.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I hadn&apos;t heard of any current pregnancies or children.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t want them, but we just haven&apos;t been blessed with the opportunity. We&apos;ve agreed to leave it to nature.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In other words, even if there was a problem with either the husband, wife, or both, he chose to avoid touching upon it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>As long as they&apos;re both satisfied, it isn&apos;t a bad choice.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see. I spoke out of turn, forget I said anything.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve always been curious, but aren&apos;t you going to get married, Ayanokouji-sensei?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I might consider it if I had someone, but unfortunately, I&apos;ve been single for a while now. No plans either.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Having a partner is essential for continuing a long political career. I hope you find someone soon, Ayanokouji-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That would be nice.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Love, marriage, childbirth&#x2014;I have no time for such things.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>They say people become stronger when they have someone to protect, but unfortunately, I don&apos;t think so.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having someone to protect also meant having a weakness.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had seen many politicians fall for the sake of those they protected.</p>",
