Eventually, many government officials would come to inspect the education conducted here.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a subtle image strategy, but it wasn&apos;t to be underestimated.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Good morning, Ayanokouji-san.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa had gone to Saitama with the engineers for a final check, holding a board and inspecting the facility. It seemed that the work was finished, and he returned to the office with a relieved expression.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;All construction is completed.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well done. Seems like the facility has turned out just as I imagined.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But to rebuild it so beautifully with that budget&#x2026; Normally, it would cost nearly double the amount.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There are more than a few construction companies that would have its dirt revealed when dug into.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If you were to threaten them a bit and whisper sweet deals in their ears, they&apos;d cooperate without considering profit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The Human Resources Development Plan is starting to feel real now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s all thanks to you, Ayanokouji-san&#x2014;for moving the people within the financial world. Raising nearly four hundred million in one night is no small feat.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That four hundred million was invested into getting educators, land, buildings, and this facility&apos;s construction.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Most of it was gone now.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Gathering money was a life-threatening feat, but spending it required no effort at all.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;They&apos;re sick of having too much money, but they&apos;re always starving for honor and fame. If this project succeeds, that&apos;s what they&apos;ll get in return. From the party&apos;s atmosphere, they&apos;re probably involved in many similar projects behind the scenes.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Including mine, they&apos;d invest in several projects at the same time, and if any of them hit, it would be a bonus. They might&apos;ve already forgotten about my existence by that point.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you saying they don&apos;t expect much?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For now, that&apos;s fine. In fact, attracting too much attention would be riskier.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, what came next was crucial.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In addition to securing teachers to provide the education, we also had to secure the children to receive that education.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But before that, I&apos;ve thought of a name for the facility that will handle the Human Resource Development Project.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh, is that so? What will you name it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;ll call it White Room. We want to emphasize white&apos;s purity in the image.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;White Room&#x2026; I see, it&#x2019;s simple, but it&apos;s nice and clear.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Anyone who looked at it would agree&#x2014;<em>this place truly lives up to its name as the White Room</em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I hope we can soon have people like Naoe-sensei and many others visiting.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa was excited, but things wouldn&apos;t proceed so easily.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kamogawa, I need to teach you something important. The world of politics isn&apos;t just about friends or foes. If you approach it with naive ideas, it could lead to irreversible consequences.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Not understanding the meaning, he tilted his head with a foolish expression.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Never mind. It seems it was too soon for you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even though everything seemed smooth, I was still walking on a bridge that could collapse at any moment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa didn&#x2019;t know the fear of walking on that bridge yet.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What will you do after this?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Today, I have scheduled interviews with several people here. It&#x2019;s impossible to run the White Room by ourselves. We&#x2019;re planning for 4 PM.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A novice trying to educate children was an impossible story.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa looked at his watch and hung his head awkwardly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With about ten minutes left until the interview time at 4 PM, he thought he was in the way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You should also attend.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh, is that okay?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re part of the White Room&apos;s management. You have the right to assess who the candidates are.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa&#x2019;s eyes sparkled with joy as he hurriedly began to tidy up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just about a minute before 4 PM, a visitor knocked on the office door.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Come in.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A man in a lab coat, Souya, approached with a light bow.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Thank you very much, Ayanokouji-san. I never thought a stray researcher like me would be approached by such a great person.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He came forth with a faint smile, seeking a handshake, but I looked down at his hand and raised my eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I haven&apos;t told you that you&apos;re hired yet.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The man who appeared, Souya, was originally a doctor but had his medical license revoked after numerous problematic behaviors. He then began research on human development and published papers. While some highly regarded his work, his past made him unwelcome on the public stage.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kamogawa, if you have any thoughts about your first impressions, feel free to speak.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is that okay&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa had been silent, not wanting to interrupt, but it was easy to see he was holding back something he wanted to say.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I want to hear your opinion.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Um, excuse me, but why did you come in a lab coat?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I couldn&#x2019;t very well come naked, could I?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&#x2019;s not what I mean&#x2026; Normally, isn&#x2019;t it common sense to wear a suit to an interview?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Souya looked at his own attire and gently nodded, though not quite convinced.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t that a trivial matter? My formal attire is a lab coat, so I see no problem. I&#x2019;d rather you see it as a sign of my seriousness.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Souya responded, unabashed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A-Ayanokouji-san&#x2026; what will you do?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&apos;Are you really considering hiring this man?&apos; his eyes seemed to plead.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, his attitude and unconventional interview attire could be seen as problematic.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, neither of those traits were necessary for the kind of talent the White Room sought.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I may not have a medical license, but I&apos;m proud of my career.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t care about your career.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed necessary to first cut off his misunderstanding.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, Souya slightly stiffened his previously flippant attitude.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&#x2019;s enough&#x2026; So, you intend to criticize what I&#x2019;ve done as well, don&#x2019;t you? I came because you said you&#x2019;d interview me regardless of past issues, but it was a mistake.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&#x2019;t jump to conclusions. I said I don&#x2019;t care about your career. That means I&apos;m not interested in your entire journey. Which university you graduated from, which hospital you worked at, what crimes you&#x2019;ve committed&#x2014;I have no interest in any of that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Souya halted as he was about to leave his seat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m only interested in your current thoughts and abilities. You excelled in your standpoint and skills as a doctor, as well as your insight into people. Do you have the confidence to demonstrate those skills?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can generally understand people just by looking at them. That hasn&apos;t changed even now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For the first time, Souya showed his face as a researcher.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It takes a certain amount of courage and resolve to step into the illegal world&#x2014;that was all I wanted to see here. Whether you can actually be useful can only truly be judged once you&apos;re out in the field.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no room to be picky about personality or such matters.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;I apologize.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without being asked, Souya gave a deep bow.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve been irritated all this time, eating through my savings since I was fired. I kept myself shut in, cutting off the outside world and myself.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;ve been regretting the mistakes you made, haven&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Regret? I&apos;m not regretting anything. Even now, when I think about why those around me betrayed me, it just makes me furious.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He didn&apos;t think for a moment that he had done anything wrong.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was precisely the kind of person that was destined to fall.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For Kamogawa, who had led a serious and gentle life, he was someone incompatible.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ll give you a chance to resurrect yourself. From now on, under me, you will manage and help grow the subjects as a researcher and former doctor, alright?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With nowhere left to go, the man wouldn&apos;t complain about being employed under the same conditions as before.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Thank you very much. I will definitely meet your expectations.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Souya was hired on the spot and sent away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you really sure it&apos;s okay to hire such a person&#x2026;? I&apos;m worried.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I understand what you want to say. However, for us, it&apos;s actually convenient.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Really?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He has no close associates around him. He&apos;s obsessed with money and doesn&apos;t seek honor from the outside world. If we provide him with money and a place to work, he won&apos;t betray us. It&apos;s impossible to make contact with outsiders and create benefits for third-party entities here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, it wasn&apos;t impossible for him to threaten us and demand a raise, but if he were to take such actions, we wouldn&apos;t need to hesitate in dealing with him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He must have understood this when he met me&#x2014;he&apos;s not someone who would benefit from making an enemy of me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If all it takes is that man to trouble us, we wouldn&apos;t last later on. It&apos;s not just Souya; there are other skilled people we&apos;ve gathered who were fired due to them causing problems.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I couldn&apos;t afford to become complacent when leading them, but their skills were certainly reliable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Additionally, there were professionals in nurturing fields. For instance, we had someone who ran an obstetrics and gynecology clinic, an ecology expert, and a coach who had trained Olympic athletes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, this was just the start. From here, we would expand further and bring in geniuses from all fields to focus on nurturing the children.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Wasn&apos;t it necessary to ask for more details? You don&apos;t know how much he can work.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Detailed explanations are unnecessary. I don&apos;t understand medicine or education anyway. For now, we&apos;ll emphasize to the other party that we can always be assertive, and we&apos;ll take and recruit any available talents indiscriminately.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So, the people coming for interviews are&#x2026; almost guaranteed to pass?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s right. So, whether you&apos;re present doesn&apos;t matter.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When it came to applying pressure, you could see it as somewhat useful.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Studying now wouldn&apos;t yield much knowledge.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was best to pit experts against experts rather than a layman meddling.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Whether he can really do it, or what the interviewees&apos; abilities are, we&apos;ll let the people we hire compete. Then, the answers will naturally emerge.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whether the education was fruitful would be analyzed by a different specialized team. If they didn&apos;t see certain results, they would simply fire them without mercy.</p>",
