Moreover, the time spent interacting with water was precious for children&apos;s stress relief.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In the two-hour swimming sessions, there was a thirty-minute lesson at the beginning, followed by a ten-minute break.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, there was a thirty-minute period of competitive swimming with set goals and times.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After that, the children were given thirty minutes of free time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We could leisurely swim in the water or choose to rest without swimming.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had made it a habit to spend the remaining thirty minutes observing the children from the poolside.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This is the place, huh? You set a new record today too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I still haven&apos;t reached the instructor&apos;s time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;re children, and the opponent is an adult. It&apos;s not strange that we can&apos;t win. What&apos;s frustrating is that I can&apos;t beat you anymore, Kiyotaka.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Until a few weeks ago, Yuki was the fastest regardless of swimming style.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ever since you overtook me, the gap in our records has been widening. How can you swim so well? I practice just as much&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Breathing.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Your form is perfect while swimming, but it breaks during breathing. If you improve that, you can shave off more time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see&#x2026; The instructor didn&apos;t point that out.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The instructor in charge of swimming doesn&apos;t tell you everything. I think they want us to find out on our own.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t that I didn&apos;t notice.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not just about yourself; you see your surroundings too. I don&apos;t have that kind of leeway.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m also struggling to keep up.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Especially with curriculums&#xa0;I was trying for the first time, I often found myself lagging behind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without basic skills, my focus inevitably went to learning, and I couldn&apos;t produce good results.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">On the other hand, people like Yuki and Shiro often performed well from their very first attempts.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They quickly absorbed the basics despite not knowing anything.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps that was what you would call having a &quot;sense&quot; of things. That was the difference.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, I didn&apos;t envy it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if there was a gap at the beginning, I could close it by learning and solidifying the basics, as proven by our numerous curriculums.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was okay to be bad at first. Building a foundation and becoming capable of applying it myself was the priority.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yuki didn&apos;t leave, opting to keep looking at me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Do you need something else?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is it weird to talk if I don&apos;t need anything?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Weird. Normally, people talk because they have something to discuss.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re the same as always, huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without looking at her, I started thinking about Yuki.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Lately, she had&#xa0;been talking more and more.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She spoke differently from me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The frequency of her initiating conversations without any specific purpose had also increased.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Why would she do such inefficient things?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As an observational subject, she wasn&apos;t bad.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Moreover, there were no instructors nearby to overhear and reprimand us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, I couldn&apos;t deny that we were under surveillance, but there was nothing they could blame us for.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Can I ask you something?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh? That&apos;s fine&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yuki was surprised by such a response and felt a bit bewildered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why are you good at conversation, Yuki?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh? Am I good at it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re at least better than me. I just can&apos;t feel motivated to talk.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t particularly have the motivation either, but&#x2026; I don&apos;t know&#x2026; I can&apos;t explain it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Speaking without understanding yourself? Truly incomprehensible.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then, why can you laugh? You laughed before, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why&#x2026;? I don&apos;t know that either.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You don&apos;t know? You changed, yet you don&apos;t know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Because I can&apos;t laugh now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, Yuki had laughed before, but since then, I couldn&apos;t recall seeing her laugh.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Was it just a chance that she laughed once?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps emotions were established through such coincidences.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t know, but I feel like I can laugh again if I&apos;m near you, Kiyotaka.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t understand that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Is it possible that people can&apos;t feel the emotion of laughter unless they&apos;re near someone specific?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No, there might&apos;ve been some truth to that.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructors often showed anger, and most of it was directed at someone else.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Smiles were also shown to others.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Thinking this way, it wasn&apos;t completely incomprehensible.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I looked at Yuki.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;What?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I thought about smiling.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But I didn&apos;t know how to smile.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I hadn&apos;t learned the basics of emotions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without the basics, nothing could be done.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s nothing.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>The fact that I haven&apos;t been taught probably means that emotions are unnecessary.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I stopped thinking about this matter.</p>",
