THE color that spread across my vision.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The first memory everyone shared was of &apos;white&apos; spreading across the entirety of the surface.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As the name &apos;White Room&apos; implied, this facility was based on the color white.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The ceiling was no exception.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In my first memory, I was staring at that pure white ceiling.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Before showing interest in my own fingertips, I just wondered what this white ceiling was.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Day after day, I just stared at the ceiling.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At first, I cried, crying out of loneliness. Eventually, I learned that no one would come to help.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That&apos;s how I see it when looking back on it now, but it was something I felt instinctively, not logically.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A newborn, unable to even speak, accepted the environment and took that as the first lesson.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After that, I became aware of my fingers.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Day after day, I looked at my small fingers, sucking on them, licking them, and passing through my empty, meaningless time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The inhuman adults brought me the nutrition necessary to live.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if I got sick, that didn&apos;t change.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They would carry out treatment unemotionally, and everyday life would return as if nothing had happened.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No one panicked, no one worried, no one rejoiced.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Eventually, I learned that I was being raised here with meticulous and strict care.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Humans held emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, these emotions were practically useless in this facility.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My still undeveloped brain learned such things at an early stage.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was no wonder. Whether I laughed, cried, got angry, or became sad, the instructors wouldn&apos;t help.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The only time I could move forward was when I achieved results.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I remembered recognizing language&#xa0;as language&#xa0;around the age of two.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In front of me, sitting opposite me, was an instructor.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Nothing laid between us. It was just the instructor extending both of their open hands toward me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Soon after, the instructor clearly placed a tiny gummy on his right hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For the children living in this facility, it was very rare to see something you could call a snack.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It had a sweetness, which I usually couldn&apos;t taste. I remembered that even as a young child, I had a normal craving for it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you can guess where the gummy is, you can eat it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The adult clenched the gummy in his right hand and extended it to me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He had on a stern, almost expressionless, face.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">On the other hand, the child facing him&#x2014;Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, or rather, I&#x2014;was also emotionless.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Both of us were expressionless, but while the instructor consciously strived to maintain the emptiness, it was natural for me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was also true for the other children.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They knew that emotions could be a hindrance&#x2014;I could tell. It was a one-on-one&#xa0;between the adults hiding their emotions and the children with minimal emotions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ll keep giving you a chance to answer until you miss three times.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructor muttered in front of me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For me, the language of adults, the meaning of each and every word, was still incomprehensible.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To &apos;miss,&apos; a &apos;chance&apos;&#x2014;both were beyond the true understanding of a two-year-old child.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, I could sense what they were trying to convey by instinct.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I could sense what was being demanded of me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To reflect exactly what I saw, I naturally touched his right hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructor immediately opened his right hand and I received a small gummy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Beside me, other children were also engaged in this task, having to guess the gummies.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">All the adults grasped it in their right hand, and all the children got it right.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Next.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This time, although he held the gummy in his right hand, he immediately switched it to his left hand and extended it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, without hesitation, I touched his left hand. Correct again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Such simple tasks were repeated two more times, and I was given a total of four pieces.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It had a modest sweetness, but in this white room, it was a popular treat among the children. I also distinctly remember having a good impression of the gummy&apos;s taste.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Next.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was the fifth time now. The instructor, this time, crossed both arms behind his back before extending the clenched gummy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The grip strength and position of the clenched hands were almost the same.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructor&apos;s expression didn&apos;t change, and there was no change in his gaze either.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At this point, there was no material to objectively judge which hand it was clenched in.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Choosing either hand gave me a fifty-fifty chance of getting it right.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">So, I prioritized time efficiency.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I casually touched the right. Then, the inside of the right hand was empty. Other children chose randomly, and although the ratio of those who chose the right hand was slightly higher, there was probably no clear reason for it. Still, all the instructors had the gummies clenched in their left hands.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Next.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Again, the instructor hid his hands behind his back, clenched them, and then brought his arms forward.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Would he continue to make us choose between simple halves?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Choosing either seemed meaningless, but I thought that I should perhaps try choosing the left.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>No&#x2014;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After briefly thinking, I decided to observe the surroundings instead of immediately answering.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The children were focused on the instructor and the gummy in front of them, paying no attention to anything else.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This time, an overwhelming number of children pointed to the left hand, but the correct answer was in the&#xa0;right.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, it was highly likely that the instructor in front of me had the gummy in his right hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I pointed to the right hand, after a slight pause, the right hand opened, and a green gummy appeared.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Next.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if I guessed correctly, I wouldn&apos;t be praised, but at least I was allowed to eat the gummy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While rolling the gummy on my tongue, I focused again. The instructor clenched the gummy behind him again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And he offered his hands at the same time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, I observed the surroundings again&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even after all the children had finished pointing, there was no sign of the hands opening.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re the last one.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Meaning, the hands wouldn&apos;t open until everyone&apos;s answers were in.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With no hints at all, I simply pointed to the right hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructors simultaneously opened the hands the children pointed at.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But, everyone got it wrong. Both children who pointed to the right hand and those who pointed to the left hand were wrong.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At this point, many children had missed their answers three times and couldn&apos;t get another chance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was only allowed one more as well.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Next.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just like the past two times, they held their clenched fists behind their backs. With no visible clues as to which hand it was in, and even after the few remaining children had finished pointing, there was no sign of the hands opening.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At this point, whether it was the right hand or the left hand, it didn&apos;t seem to make a difference.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Was that really the case?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&#x2026;Or&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was my last chance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If it wasn&apos;t held in either of them&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructor hadn&apos;t said which hand held the gummy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He had only asked to point where the gummy was.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That meant there was a possibility it was hidden somewhere other than the left or right hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I allowed my childish thoughts to wander and pointed behind without touching either hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without answering, he watched my action.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why point behind?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Gummy, it&apos;s not there.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Unable to perfectly control my language yet, I answered like that.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Silently, the instructor opened both hands at the same time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, a small gummy was held in his right hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Too bad. The correct answer was the right hand.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Saying so, the instructor put the small gummy into his own mouth.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">One of the remaining two children had guessed the right hand correctly and was given a gummy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ll give you one more chance, just this once, as a special exception.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He took out another gummy, hid it behind his back, and thrust both arms forward.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I thought both hands were empty because he hid it behind, but actually, it was held in the right hand. So, had I simply missed a fifty-fifty chance, and it wasn&apos;t hidden from the start?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Or, after hiding it twice, did he anticipate that I would read his moves as such and deliberately hold onto it? Here, the possibility of both hands being empty might actually be higher than him holding it. The remaining child pointed to the left hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>What should I do&#x2026;?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Right hand, left hand, or was it hidden behind?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Behind.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After thinking for a bit, I took a gamble. Discarding both the right and left hands, I judged them to be empty.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructor opened both hands. Then, a small gummy was held in his left hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Too bad again. Are you frustrated?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was true that I was reluctant.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I nodded slightly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t because I wanted the gummy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The frustration of realizing that my thinking was off&#x2014;it was something like that.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He really is different, this child.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Near me, the gathered adults were whispering something.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At the age of two, I couldn&apos;t understand the complex meanings of words, so I only remembered it as a mere sequence of words at the time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Other than Kiyotaka, all the children naturally only guessed left or right. However, he observed what choices others made and was clearly aware that a third option existed, to hide it behind. Moreover, even after proving it wasn&apos;t hidden behind, he didn&apos;t discard the possibility of it being hidden there. This isn&apos;t the thought process of a two-year-old.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Aren&apos;t you overthinking things?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;However, in several tests so far, this child is the only one that clearly holds a different perspective and point of view.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Amid their thoughts that I couldn&apos;t fully understand, I engraved the instructors&apos; words into memories.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>In the future, this conversation might give me hints.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>When I grow up, it would be good to open this memory drawer.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;It&apos;s creepy how he looks at us. Maybe he understands what we&apos;re talking about.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No way&#x2026; He&apos;s two years old. He shouldn&apos;t understand anything more than the bare minimum.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s true, but&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The buzzer sounded, signaling the end of the test.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The adults looked at each other, instructed the children to stay put, and went outside.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The children, accustomed to the scene, watched their figures leave without a single one crying.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The unease of being left alone with just the other children had long since vanished.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We&apos;d receive no help.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That fact was deeply ingrained in me at the age of two.</p>",
