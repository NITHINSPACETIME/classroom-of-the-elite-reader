We&apos;ll also be hiring Tabuchi, who I felt was the most sensible. The rest have too many issues with their inner character despite their high capabilities, so I&apos;m not planning on hiring them this time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Setting aside their comments, their background and way of thinking were impressive. I can&#x2019;t fully understand it, though&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wondered if this would help the project start running smoothly, but the uncertainty remained, and the interview didn&apos;t clear my doubts. I couldn&apos;t shake off the anxiety.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even though they were competent, it didn&apos;t feel like anything exceptional.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Is it really possible to provide the best education with this?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Shall we go for a meal?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>It&apos;s pointless to keep thinking about it. For now, it&apos;s best to reset and clear my mind.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Right! Let&apos;s go all out at times like this!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Immediately after I decided to invite Kamogawa for a meal, I took out my phone from my pocket.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji-san, I think you dropped something?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Saying so, he picked up a piece of paper from the floor and handed it to me. It was a business card.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Tsukishiro, huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>According to Naoe-sensei, he seems to be a jack-of-all-trades&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh, I remember receiving it. It&apos;s all crumpled though.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It might be good to check how useful he can be.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh, are you going to contact him? He seemed like someone with a scary smile&#xa0;though&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Jack-of-all-trades</em>&#x2014;it was a suspicious title, but there was no way that Naoe-sensei would keep someone useless by his side.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>It might be worth trying to contact him.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&#xa0;dialed the number written on the business card.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If it didn&apos;t connect, I could simply assume it wasn&apos;t meant to be.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was how I felt.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After entering the number and hearing a few rings&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I was expecting your call, Ayanokouji-san.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The man on the phone, presumably Tsukishiro, answered without hesitation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How come you knew it was me?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had never given my number to Tsukishiro, and this was genuinely my first time calling.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s only natural to do some research beforehand.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t like it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Finding out a phone number wasn&apos;t surprising.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It would be easy to find out from Naoe-sensei&apos;s secretary or someone around him. What I didn&apos;t like was his attitude. It was as if he had foreseen the call.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What has Naoe-sensei told you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It didn&apos;t seem like a mere introduction. I intuitively felt there was a scheme behind it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I understand what you&apos;re saying, but I can&apos;t answer that here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re watching to see if I mess up, aren&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just from his voice, it was impossible to sense his agitation or true intentions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, that could also be a dangerous judgment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At least intuitively, I didn&apos;t think this man, Tsukishiro, would allow any weaknesses to show so easily.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Would it be possible to meet soon? I might be able to meet your expectations.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While I was thinking, Tsukishiro offered to meet.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Expectations?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Didn&apos;t you call me because you have a problem?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re quite sure of yourself. I haven&apos;t even mentioned the details yet. You might regret raising my expectations too high.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If necessary, I can come now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Now? He seems very confident.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Or perhaps there&apos;s another motive.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&#xa0;was wary of a trap, but I decided to go along with the conversation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then we&apos;ll get things started now. I won&apos;t let you say it&apos;s impossible.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course. What should we do then? I can come over. You&apos;re at the office at the moment, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;You bastard.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>He knows I&apos;m staying at the office?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I think it would be smoother if I came to you. May I take about an hour of your time?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do whatever you want.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whether Tsukishiro was certain I would make contact was another issue, but there was no doubt he was investigating my surroundings and had information gathered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This large-scale project always seemed to have information constantly circulating, with Naoe-sensei at its center.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Um, what happened?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m meeting Tsukishiro now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What, right now!? What about food&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You go eat alone. I&apos;ll meet him by myself.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As long as Kamogawa was partially involved in the project, he was a treasure trove of information.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Given that the other party might become an enemy, his presence could be a hindrance.</p>",
