Recorded by Suzukake Tanji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Suzukake set his phone to video recording mode and placed it on the desk.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, he pointed the lens to face him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For a long time, I&apos;ve been in charge of the education in this White Room.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">On this day, Suzukake decided to quietly leave his thoughts on the research stored in his phone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;However, the White Room will be halted for a while starting today. I don&apos;t understand the politics, but it seems that a politician named Naoe has been working to prevent Ayanokouji-sensei&apos;s return. He&apos;s caused us some trouble. However, I decided to think positively. An extended vacation after a long time without one&#x2014;that&apos;s not too bad.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Taking a breather, Suzukake powered off the computer monitor.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;People are very interesting. This applies to all children, but there are signs they&apos;re learning things I haven&apos;t taught them. Just as they can breathe without being taught how to breathe, the children are seeking communication even in a closed environment. I realized this after educating the first generation to the fourth one, and I introduced a communication curriculum from the fifth generation onward. Of course, this created some inefficiencies. While it generated emotions, it decreased the rate at which their abilities improved. Nevertheless, the curriculum&apos;s difficulty was slightly increased, and starting from the fifth generation, they achieved abilities superior to the third-generation students.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Punishment should be executed, and emotions are only to be kept at a minimum</em>&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Suzukake still hadn&apos;t changed this way of thinking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The curriculum was prepared in ten different levels; in the end, the fourth level of difficulty was applied to the fifth generation and the fifth level to the sixth generation. This was probably the limit. The seventh generation received the sixth level, but everyone has already dropped out. From the eighth generation onward, I&apos;ve been continuing their education by skillfully using a mix of the fourth and fifth difficulty levels. Eventually, these children will become the ideal adults. As individuals who can blend into the world, they&apos;ll be able to integrate.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Suzukake fell silent for a while.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, you can easily understand this matter by simply looking at the files, can&apos;t you? I&apos;ve decided to leave a record today so that I don&apos;t forget the amount of passion that kept me going. The White Room has already seen many children that get educated and drop out, but that child&apos;s&#x2026; Ayanokouji Kiyotaka&apos;s presence is significant. His abnormal learning ability, adaptability, applicability, and talent continue to surprise me daily, and his evaluation never ceases to grow. Other researchers in the White Room believe that they can nurture children just like him, but if you ask me, he&apos;s an exception. Even in this distorted environment, you could call him a particularly unique existence. Truly a mutation.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With his own creation, the Beta curriculum, a product of the most challenging and thorough education was created.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No&#x2026; It&apos;s hard to say whether you could call it a product. After all, it can&apos;t be reproduced. However, Kiyotaka wasn&apos;t perfect from the beginning. Whether it was academics, karate, or boxing, his performance in things he touched for the first time was rather unremarkable. The difference started from there. He had the extraordinary ability to absorb things and sublimate them into his own skills. Once he finished learning the basics, using his exceptional ability that allowed him to apply what he learned, he would then begin to acquire the technique needed to deal with topics he only tried once.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if he closed his eyes, Kiyotaka&apos;s image was imprinted behind his eyelids.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;By the eighth year, the number of children remaining had reduced to five. Considering there were originally seventy-four, the dropout rate exceeded 93%. The average dropout rate from the first to the third generation was 27%, and from the fifth generation onward, it was 30%. The Beta curriculum was indeed reckless. At that point, I feared that everyone would drop out in the middle of the ninth year. No&#x2026; rather, I hoped that they would drop out. If a child stayed under a curriculum that humans weren&apos;t meant to continue and were capable of carrying on&#x2026; they would no longer seem human&#x2014;they&apos;d be a monster. That cannot exist. As if to prove against it, by the time the new spring arrived, at last, one child remained. However&#x2026; the&#xa0;problem started from there. That remaining child showed no signs of dropping out even after ten, eleven, twelve years. On the contrary, they&apos;ve started to surpass us researchers and instructors. The adults who come with half-baked knowledge can&apos;t even last a few days and leave the White Room with their heads in their hands. Originally, the White Room&apos;s purpose was to continue education until the children reached adulthood. However, another six years&#x2026; it&apos;s impossible. That child will surpass our common sense in the near future. This isn&apos;t a premonition but a conviction. At the same time, it became unclear&#x2014;was it an existence created by my curriculum or a genetic mutation? I cannot prove why he&apos;s continued to survive without dropping out. It&apos;s driving me crazy.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>So&#x2026; how should we perceive the White Room and Kiyotaka&apos;s existence going forward?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ultimately, the decision was made by Ayanokouji Atsuomi, the facility&apos;s representative, but there was a big divide among the researchers.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Whether an artificial genius can be created is still unanswered, but it&apos;s been proven that it&apos;s possible to create extraordinary individuals through the White Room. However, every child has a cap that becomes their limit.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Suzukake glanced at an empty cup, which just a few minutes ago contained sencha tea. He took the cap off of the brand-new bottle of mineral water, and he held up the cup and bottle cap.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This represents the magnitude of the educator&apos;s talent. This small cap is, so to speak, the limit of an ordinary educator&apos;s talent. Compared to the cap, this much larger cup can easily be interpreted as the talent belonging to the educators inside the White Room. The children receiving education will raise their own limits according to the limits of these educators&apos; talent. If an ordinary person stops at cap size, then receiving an education here could stretch their talent to the size of the cup.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He poured new mineral water into the cup.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Once the limit&apos;s been reached, there&apos;s basically no more room for growth. The water overflows and spills, and absorbing new content becomes impossible&#x2026; No, that&apos;s not the right expression. Every time new knowledge is absorbed, old abilities are gradually lost, unbeknownst to the person themselves.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Watching the water overflow and disperse across the desk, Suzukake sighed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There are various problems ahead. First, there are only a limited number of people who have the talent proportional to the size of this cup. Next, even if they have the talent, it doesn&apos;t mean they have the skills to teach them. Additionally, not everyone will necessarily acquire talent up to the same level. While the upper limit is the size of the cup, in many cases, there are those that end up being one or two sizes smaller. Of course, there are cases where children end up one or two sizes larger, but the probability is inferior to the former. And here&apos;s the most important part: those who could truly be called geniuses in this world aren&apos;t limited to the size of the cup. They possess talent comparable to this mineral water bottle, no, they may even possess greater talent. However, people who have both exceptional talent while also having the skills to teach it are virtually nonexistent. Even if they do exist, it&apos;s unlikely that the children will grow larger than the cup.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was clearly evident from the research data so far.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A nurturing education that considers the needs of children, or, conversely, a strict and rigorous education&#x2014;whichever the case, isn&#x2019;t there still a limit to the innate potential that children can possess?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The White Room project was about creating geniuses from ordinary people and developing talents that could compete with the world.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s possible to intentionally create humans who fall within the top 10% of the human category. In that sense, the White Room is established as an institution that can produce certain results. However, it may not be possible to create humans who fall within the top 0.01% that can compete with the world.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For the researcher, this was a sense of defeat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Suzukake felt this through Ayanokouji Kiyotaka.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That child currently shows no upper limit to his talent. The more he&apos;s taught, the more he absorbs. He could be said to be a natural-born genius or a result of education in the White Room, but I think both are correct and incorrect. If Kiyotaka hadn&apos;t received the White Room&apos;s education, he probably would&apos;ve been a fairly talented person, that&apos;s all. Without either element, he wouldn&apos;t have been created&#x2026; If Kiyotaka continues his education in the White Room, it&apos;s clear that he&apos;ll become a valuable asset in significantly raising the talent ceiling for the next generation of children. If Kiyotaka were to stand here in my place and take on the role of an instructor, those children wouldn&apos;t only grow to the size of the cup, but perhaps even the size of the bottle&#x2026; I would definitely like to see that process.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Angels and demons questioned him in his mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>If, instead of remaining a small-scale White Room educator, he&apos;s sent out into the world as a leader guiding Japan, how much achievement would he leave behind?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>For Japan, for the future&#x2014;which choice would be more meaningful?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>The final judgment isn&apos;t mine to make, but which decision will Ayanokouji-sensei choose?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I intend to witness everything. And, regardless of that choice, I plan to continue being involved in the White Room&apos;s education for life.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Unlike the time when he was chased out of Japan and had to flee overseas, nothing else was as enjoyable, filled with a sense of fulfillment, as this.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But&#x2026; no matter how excellent, if asked whether Ayanokouji Kiyotaka is truly a genius, a doubt remains. He&apos;s significantly inferior to ordinary people emotionally, and he isn&apos;t aware of the common knowledge most people know. He would learn if he studied, but it&apos;s unknown how much of a detriment that would cause. He&apos;s imperfect.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While continuing to talk, Suzukake reached for his phone and stopped the recording.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I wonder if that child I created&#x2026; will grasp happiness at his dying moment&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As a researcher, he felt a strong resistance to leaving such a statement on record.</p>",
