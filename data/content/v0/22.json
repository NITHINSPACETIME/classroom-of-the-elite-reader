This is the first face-to-face meeting, but you&apos;ve had many discussions online. I believe there will be no issues with coordination.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Please wait. We have indeed discussed this many times, but our directions and policies are completely different. How do you expect us to align our plans?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The elder, Souya, strongly expressed his opinion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ishida and Suzukake, on the other hand, didn&apos;t even attempt to compromise, their faces full of confidence that their own ideologies were correct. This was no surprise, as it had been the same during the repeated online meetings.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a group that would never agree, no matter how long they discussed educational directions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What if I said you had to twist your arguments and obey?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s impossible. In that case, I would have to step down.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Immediately, Ishida responded.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m the same. I came here only to implement my ideal education. If I can&apos;t do that, I have no intention of working.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Suzukake felt the same. He had never even considered compromising from the start.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What is this disrespectful attitude towards Ayanokouji-san? I know you&apos;ve been paid a decent amount of money during the preparation phase.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa, a novice in educational theory, couldn&apos;t overlook such disrespectful attitudes. However, I reprimanded Kamogawa for that.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I said something confusing, but there&apos;s no need to jump to conclusions.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There were a total of fifteen children ready to be used immediately.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Fifteen business card-sized papers with the infants&apos; names, genders, and birthdates were&#xa0;laid face down.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, as if shuffling cards, the papers were mixed and placed on the desk.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ishida, Suzukake, Souya. You will each randomly select five pieces of papers from here. These will be the children you educate and are responsible for. Educate them for a certain period. The first generation of White Room students will be raised in three parallel groups. Tabuchi has already agreed to monitor you three equally.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Tabuchi nodded and then looked at each of the three one by one.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s a good idea. Since our values don&apos;t align, this is the only choice.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The conclusion I had reached was to let these three compete freely.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was an impossible task to ask geniuses with different ideals and beliefs to align from the start.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;However, it can&apos;t go on forever. The training period you get is three years. When all the children reach the age of three, a comprehensive test will be conducted, and the person who led the best-performing group will be the official leader.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No one thought they would lose, so there was no element of concern.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ishida was satisfied with the content and nodded, reaching for the paper, so I glared and grabbed his arm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;W-What!?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do you hear me? If you spout nonsense about the children having different talents or refuse to follow this decision after losing, understand that the three years&apos; worth of money marked in your bank account would disappear as a penalty. Plus, you&apos;ll completely lose your standing not just in the public society but also in the underworld. Don&apos;t ever forget that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The Ishida in front of me swallowed slow and hard.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And you two, are you okay with this?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No objections.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Souya seemed to have understood, but he must&apos;ve taken it to heart again after what I said.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, Suzukake still showed a stern face.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you have complaints, say them now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I understand. What bothers me is the part about following the leader. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll lose, but I want to know how those who follow me will act. Are you saying to blindly follow a leader with different principles? If that&apos;s the case, I&apos;m not willing to accept.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you only want yes-men, geniuses are unnecessary. Especially not three oddballs like you. The leader will have the final decision. However, if there are objections to the educational policy, we have to hold thorough discussions. That&apos;s also why Tabuchi is here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s like the ruling party and the opposition, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa, impressed, said something politician-like.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;I understand.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ishida regained his composure, yet his confident demeanor remained unchanged.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>There would be delays in the plan, but this is probably the best choice for now.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Only the first generation would be raised in three groups over the three years, and then a leader would be decided to unify them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It would cost money and reduce efficiency, but it was a necessary measure to unite the educators.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A new educational policy would be created, and the creation of a new generation would start each year.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I might have to make various revisions to the plan along the way, but this is the best choice available for now.</em></p>",
