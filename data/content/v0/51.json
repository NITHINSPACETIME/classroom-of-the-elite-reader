If we were to employ a conventional strategy, it would involve dedicating a lifetime to nurturing outstanding talents in the White Room, like Suzukake. Eventually, this might lead to multiple existences similar to Kiyotaka emerging.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Wasn&apos;t that the original plan? Wouldn&apos;t that be fine?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;My political comeback is starting to feel more tangible. That&apos;s what&apos;s making me hesitate.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No way&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s frustrating that there&apos;s an age limit in the political world; it&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve felt this way.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You intend to make him, Kiyotaka-kun, a politician&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For a White Room educator, the strategy to pass on the role to the next generation is the White Room&apos;s true nature. It&apos;s a crucial project that cannot be avoided if Japan is to lead the world fifty or one hundred years from now. That remains unchanged for me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>However&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But, to reach the pinnacle in politics, I need a strong ally. The earliest Kiyotaka can become an elected official, after reaching adulthood, is at age twenty-five. By then, I&apos;ll be sixty-one. It&apos;s just about possible.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Though, as a politician, that&apos;d be the perfect timing for him to fully mature and come into his prime.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, Kiyotaka becoming a Diet member wouldn&apos;t immediately enable him to accomplish anything.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, theoretically, from age twenty-five, he&apos;d have the right to be appointed as the prime minister. He&apos;d have the potential to be far more useful than the countless mediocre, do-nothing politicians.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you intend to do&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I haven&apos;t decided yet. If either I or Kiyotaka can dominate the political scene, we could significantly change Japan without having to discuss matters fifty or a hundred years into the future. However, this would inevitably delay the White Room&apos;s education. That&apos;s why it&apos;s troubling.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The most frustrating thing was that he already held the title of being my son.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If he were to enter the world of politics, the public would simply see it as me wanting to pass on my legacy to a second generation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>It&apos;s a significant disadvantage. However, I think there might be a way to make the most of it.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Moreover, his lack of emotions&#x2014;joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness&#x2014;and his uneasiness with emotions were also major concerns. It was necessary to improve on this.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kiyotaka-kun would obediently follow along, and you&apos;d want to place various expectations on him, wouldn&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Obedient</em>. It was uncertain how much I could control Kiyotaka myself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">His intellect had already significantly surpassed ours.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although his emotions were faint, his thoughts moved, and he&apos;d likely outsmart us in two or three moves. However, his lack of worldly knowledge was a fortunate weakness. He hadn&apos;t reached the level where he could understand my cautious thoughts yet.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From this point on, preparations to change the plan were set in place.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My will to take control of this country was strong and unwavering.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Today, Kamogawa, I&apos;ll need you to stick around a bit longer.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whatever the approach, the first thing that needed to be addressed was regarding the development of his individuality, and it was about time to start taking those measures.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s fine, but what do you intend to do?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just then, a hand softly knocked on the car window, and Tsukishiro naturally climbed into the vacant driver&apos;s seat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This man had connections not only in both the ruling and opposing parties but also in the financial world. His stance, to back the winning horse, meant high risks and low trust, but even now, in his old age, his skills were reliable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You seem well, Ayanokouji-san. I hear you&apos;ve been getting along quite well with the people from the Peace Party lately.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That doesn&apos;t matter. What about the situation I asked you to handle?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The arrangements are complete. There won&apos;t be any issues with his background being checked.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Good. There&apos;s something else I want to ask you about for the future.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I explained my future plans to Tsukishiro and Kamogawa.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As&#xa0;Kamogawa remained in shock, Tsukishiro listened with a calm smile.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It sounds like an interesting proposal. I&apos;d like to say I welcome the work, but I&apos;m getting old. It might not be as easy as when I was younger.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He spoke humbly, but this man wouldn&apos;t take on something he couldn&apos;t handle.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re the right person for this. I want to see how far he can go.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you entrust it to me, very well, I understand. I&apos;ll cooperate when it comes time for you to implement your plan. Later on, we&apos;ll need to prepare some additional pieces that we might lack.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I instructed him to start the car, and Tsukishiro turned on the engine.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I only discussed matters related to Kiyotaka&apos;s future with the unreliable Tsukishiro. However, that wasn&apos;t my only goal. I also wanted to grasp my enemies&apos; weaknesses&#x2014;Kijima&apos;s and ANHS&apos;s weaknesses&#x2014;which I would eventually need to exploit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In one year, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka would decide to enroll in the Advanced Nurturing High School.</p>",
