There wasn&apos;t an option for what would happen if we didn&apos;t meet our quotas.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was predetermined that everyone would meet it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Those who couldn&apos;t comply wouldn&apos;t be allowed to enter this room from the next day on.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">By the time all these procedures were completed, it was 8:00 AM.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Our breakfast, focused on nutrition, had evolved from early childhood to be more efficient with supplements and nutrition blocks.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whether it was tasty or not.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whether I liked it or not.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It didn&apos;t matter, as always.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We ate the food in the order they were served.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was all.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After we finished our meal, the day&apos;s curriculum would start.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The subjects varied widely, starting with language arts and mathematics, and it also included economics and political science. With brief breaks in between, this repeated until noon.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For lunch, we ate a similar menu to breakfast, and the curriculum resumed in the afternoon.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After studying at our desks until 5:00 PM, we began physical education.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Everything ended at 7:00 PM.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">During this time, we had never once spoken voluntarily.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After we ate dinner, bathed, and finished our physical examination, it was 9:00 PM.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, for the first time, a time for us to talk, what we called a meeting, was provided for us to reflect on the day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a conversation that took place in a small space just for the children, without any of the educators present.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, we couldn&apos;t freely choose the topics.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">How we felt about that day&apos;s studies and how we dealt with it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was&#xa0;a time to organize and carefully examine what we had learned.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The adults wouldn&apos;t interfere unless they recognized it as unnecessary chatter.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We were also permitted to remain silent, regardless of whether we would profit or lose from it, as long as we followed the rules.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It only lasted thirty minutes, but I never felt like actively speaking; I would always just listen to their conversation. Even though the children were allowed to talk among themselves, our conversations were overheard by the adults.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This exchange was undoubtedly part of the curriculum.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, there was no specific quota assigned.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though, it was probably a measure to draw out the children&apos;s true feelings.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If they were to clumsily set a quota, the conversation would naturally be directed toward fulfilling it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At 9:30 PM, we were sent back to our rooms.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After using the bathroom, we were obligated to lie down in bed by 10:00 PM.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Electrodes were attached, and the lights were turned off.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Medical checks were always required.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter the day, 365 days a year, there was always time set aside to check on the state of things for that day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was the end of the day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From the point we woke up to the point we went to bed, that was our educational policy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Everything was scheduled down to the minute.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was a day in the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a world that didn&apos;t change for an entire year.</p>",
