When will Naoe-sensei arrive&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa, who was complaining for the third time, warmed his hands through his breath.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s always like this. For Naoe-sensei, the appointed time is merely a guideline.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Does that mean, at worst, he could even be one or two hours late?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed that, for this man, that was the worst-case scenario.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re naive. We&apos;re lucky if he comes here today at all. Oftentimes, he doesn&apos;t even show up.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eeeeh&#x2026; Really&#x2026;? Then how long are we going to wait for someone who might not arrive?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Forever. Unless we get a message, we wait even if the shop closes.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;ll die doing that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you claim to be part of the Naoe faction, you should be happy to die. Not that Naoe-sensei would ever care about someone who&#x2019;s already dead, though.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We were merely intermediaries and nothing more.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Rather, those who are already inside the ryoutei waiting for Naoe-sensei must be really anxious.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But... it&apos;s&#xa0;amazing how he&#x2019;s forgiven for being careless with time. Normally, you&apos;d get scolded.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;<em>Careless with time</em>&#x2014;do you really think so?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Because that&apos;s how he is, isn&apos;t he?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even being late is a weapon for Naoe-sensei. Like the anecdote of&#xa0;Miyamoto Musashi at Ganryujima.&quot;<sup id=\"fnref-2-69cbbc33-47d8-5c10-aef6-eac3a1172ee2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-2-69cbbc33-47d8-5c10-aef6-eac3a1172ee2\" data-ref=\"2\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[2]</a></sup></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, normally, no one would use such outdated strategies.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was precisely because it was Naoe-sensei that such drastic displays of power were allowed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;As a general rule, eighty percent of those who are stood&#xa0;up are just compelled to go along with it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This statistic was proof that few could stand up to Naoe-sensei.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even the current prime minister had no choice but to constantly consult Naoe-sensei.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter how long they were made to wait, they&#x2019;d greet Naoe-sensei with a smile.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What about the remaining twenty percent?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s the point of hearing about the remaining twenty percent of fools?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&#x2019;s just for reference&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Those fools get irritated at being stood up and raise their voices. Then, closing in on me with the momentum to throw a punch, they demand, &apos;How long will you make us wait? Call Naoe-sensei now!&apos;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa, situated next to me, swallowed his saliva with a gulp.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This man, while still new to the political world, understood the terror of giving Naoe-sensei demands.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But each time, I would respond to everyone with a resolute attitude.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&apos;It would be troublesome if you look down on Naoe-sensei&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll just dismiss them like that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They&apos;d either bow their heads and hope for another appointment, or they&apos;d never show their face again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With this, another eighty percent would bow their heads again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While cursing internally, they would prioritize having an audience with Naoe-sensei. Well, choosing this option meant it was almost impossible to have a smooth relationship with him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It seems tough for you, Ayanokouji-san&#x2014;being the intermediary and all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;They say&#xa0;that seeking hardship is good, even if you have to pay for it, but I&apos;ve been hit once or twice. I&apos;ve even been nearly hit with ashtrays and golf clubs.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since they couldn&apos;t lay a hand on Naoe-sensei, they had no choice but to vent their frustration on me. But even if I got hit, Naoe-sensei wouldn&apos;t care.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It must be rough. Have you been doing this for nearly four years, Ayanokouji-san?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s simple, but it isn&apos;t something just anyone can do. Though, if you&apos;re prepared to die for it, anyone can do it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was why the opportunity came around to me, who had no backing, education, intellect, or family lineage.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Still, this guy knows too little.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>He&apos;s two years older than me and a first-year rookie as a legislator...</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Didn&apos;t Representative Kamogawa teach you the iron rules?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The man standing next to me was the kind of politician I despised the most.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;My father didn&apos;t teach me anything...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A typical second-generation politician. Spoiled and destined to survive in the world of politics like a leech.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A despised leech, yet that was a privilege only the chosen ones born into the privileged class could attain.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Representative Kamogawa Toshizou, who had supported Naoe-sensei for many years, was a veteran politician with over thirty years of experience in this territory.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Naturally, he wouldn&apos;t let his son experience the harsh groundwork. Unlike me, a disposable pawn who could be broken, he was treasured as a role that supported the Naoe faction&apos;s backbone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I was just taught to silently follow Naoe-sensei&#x2014;if I do that, I would be safe as a politician. I could be a Diet member for a long time, have a stable salary, and eventually get a decent position.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa became a politician not because he had any achievements in mind, but because he just&#xa0;wanted to survive.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Such people existed, whether they were second-generation or not.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a foolish and rotten way of thinking, but this type of person tended to live unnecessarily long.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just by keeping them tamed, others could secure a vote within the group without any complaints, which was a welcome presence for those in power.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I want to finish my groundwork quickly and get to the easy jobs.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa grumbled as he looked up at the night sky.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m hungry too&#x2026; On such a cold day, nothing beats hot sake.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Can&apos;t this guy even wait in silence?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Shut up for a bit, Kamogawa.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why not talk a little? Sensei isn&apos;t around. Besides, please tell me more about Naoe-sensei and you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was caught off guard by the latter part of his words.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;About me?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve heard rumors. They say that people who work under Naoe-sensei are usually fast to become useless, but you&apos;re a treasured newcomer. I&apos;d love to know your secret.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa talked about the rumors as if they were someone else&apos;s business. I felt the urge to punch him right then and there, but doing so would only provide a moment of relief.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even after four years, I was still considered a newcomer. That was the real issue that needed to be addressed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Chatting time&apos;s over. Switch gears.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I immediately straightened up at the faint sound of a taxi approaching.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa, realizing what that meant, coughed and followed suit, straightening his back as well.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The taxi slowly arrived in front of the <em>ryoutei</em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Immediately after, another black sedan stopped a short distance behind the taxi. It was clear without having to look over that they were Naoe-sensei&apos;s bodyguards.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I quickly shifted my gaze back to the taxi, but the door didn&apos;t open, and Kamogawa tilted his head in confusion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Through the window, I could see Naoe-sensei. Just as Kamogawa was about to rush over, I stopped him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t do anything rash.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh, but...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From what little could be seen through the taxi&apos;s back seat window, a man and a woman were intimately touching each other.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Interfering here could risk receiving unnecessary reprimands.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, it was rare for Naoe-sensei to be with a woman.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even though it was in the middle of the night from within a taxi, it seemed careless for a politician. After about a minute of silence in the taxi&apos;s back seat, the door finally opened.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;See you later, Sensei~&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The voice of a young woman, who had been sitting on the far side, could be heard, and finally, Kamogawa understood.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After talking with the woman for a little longer, Naoe-sensei slowly got out of the taxi.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From the passenger seat of the sedan behind, a slim man immediately got out.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without a word, he silently stood next to Naoe-sensei.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a new face among the bodyguards that I hadn&apos;t seen before. However, I had no time to worry about it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Good work today, Naoe-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh, good work!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa was either disturbed by seeing the scene with the woman, or he was simply nervous in front of Naoe-sensei.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if it was the latter, it was foolish to act in a way that could be interpreted as the former.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I moved half a step ahead of the bothersome Kamogawa and blocked his face with my shoulder.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, that might&apos;ve been an unnecessary concern.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Naoe-sensei, who had no interest in Kamogawa, directed his sharp gaze only towards the <em>ryoutei</em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Where is Asama?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The way he wore his suit and his posture, which didn&apos;t seem fitting for an elderly man, conveyed a sense of youthfulness.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He&apos;s been waiting. I&apos;ll guide you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With my eyes, I signaled the nervous Kamogawa behind me to pay the taxi fare. Afterward, I led Naoe-sensei into the <em>ryoutei</em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As soon as we entered, from the proprietress to the head chef, everyone hurriedly appeared and bowed their heads.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Naoe-sensei, maintaining his expression, took off his shoes while still enveloped in a strong aura.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He stepped on the wooden floor and headed towards the private room at the far end of the establishment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Naoe Jinnosuke. He belonged to the ruling Citizens&apos; Party and previously held numerous positions, such as Minister of Transport and Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry. He was currently serving as the secretary-general, also known as the chief secretary of the party.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The secretary-general&apos;s position was technically a step behind the prime minister and the deputy prime minister, but in terms of importance, it was significantly higher.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was the real power holder of the party.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This man, who was turning sixty-eight this year, showed no signs of retiring.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In the world of politics, where there were no mandatory retirement conditions unless there were health issues, this man would likely remain in his position for another ten or even twenty years.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Asama-sensei, I&apos;ve brought Naoe-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Behind the sliding doors, Asama-sensei, who was waiting in a formal seated position, stood up and bowed deeply upon seeing Naoe-sensei.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Asama Hisashi. At seventy-one, he was three years older than Naoe-sensei.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was serving as the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, a key figure in the Naoe faction.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To me, even Asama-sensei seemed like he was living in a world beyond my reach.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, as soon as Naoe-sensei appeared, the roles switched instantly to master and servant.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The power difference was clearly visible in this routine scene.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve been waiting for you, Naoe-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting, Asama. Work has been hectic.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m aware of your busy schedule.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I bowed deeply enough to rub my forehead on the tatami mat and quietly closed the sliding doors so as not to disturb their conversation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From this point on, listening to the conversation of these two major politicians wasn&apos;t permitted.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let&apos;s get straight to the point, Naoe-sensei, about that matter...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Only a single sliding door separated us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There were times when the devil tempted me to eavesdrop to obtain useful information.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Or perhaps it would tell me that planting a listening device wouldn&apos;t be a problem.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, the world wasn&apos;t so forgiving.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Any scheming would be quickly exposed, and my political career would be cut short.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I stood up, left the scene, and moved to a separate room far away.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"b6ad045c-3a8a-59c5-b2e4-d114127d5319\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-b6ad045c-3a8a-59c5-b2e4-d114127d5319\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-b6ad045c-3a8a-59c5-b2e4-d114127d5319\">[1]: </a>(&#x6599;&#x4ead;, ryoutei) A ryoutei is a type of luxurious traditional Japanese restaurant.</p></li><li data-id=\"69cbbc33-47d8-5c10-aef6-eac3a1172ee2\" data-ref=\"2\" class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-2-69cbbc33-47d8-5c10-aef6-eac3a1172ee2\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-2-69cbbc33-47d8-5c10-aef6-eac3a1172ee2\">[2]: </a>The story of Ganryujima Island and Musashi Miyamoto refers to a duel between two Japanese swordsmen where Musashi Miyamoto arrived three hours late.</p></li></ol>",
