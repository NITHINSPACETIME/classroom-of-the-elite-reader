An identifying sequence of letters.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A crucial element for distinguishing humans.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">All of us in the White Room were taught names as a way to identify people. However, when we were young, we were not told our surnames, and the instructors called everyone by their first names.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t know at the time, but there was an inconvenience that came with giving the children their surnames&#x2014;it seemed that the rule was set due to concerns that it could potentially lead to someone getting identified in the future.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">By the time I turned four, new curriculums were being implemented around me one after another.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let&apos;s commence the exam now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The most important of the tests was the written exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Everyone sat up straight and faced the exam papers.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The characters consisted of hiragana, katakana, the alphabet<sup id=\"fnref-1-43c88498-c709-5852-82a9-d064a0c8cf90\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-43c88498-c709-5852-82a9-d064a0c8cf90\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup>, numbers, and simple kanji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since we were thoroughly taught reading and writing the year we were three, the pen-gripping fingers moved without the slightest hesitation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If we hadn&apos;t achieved a certain score within the limited time, we&apos;d receive a penalty.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At the same time, we were also required to maintain an elegant handwriting.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if we had good handwriting, we weren&apos;t given extra points. However, we needed to write with care since hurried and poor handwriting would result in deductions. No one in this facility asked whether the problems could be solved or not.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The only answer was that everyone could do it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Those who couldn&apos;t were eliminated at the age of three.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Our group, titled the fourth generation, initially consisted of seventy-four people.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, as mentioned earlier, children who were judged incapable at age three had already dropped out of the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Now, except for our sleeping hours, we shared almost all our time with each other.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The written exam would last for thirty minutes. However, if we were able to solve the problems without getting lost in them, it would only take about half to two-thirds of the time to finish.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was a commonality in all of the written exams conducted in the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Solve the problem and move on to the next. Reach the answer and write it down.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At the same time, review the previous question to ensure there were no mistakes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When everything was done being written, I raised my right hand straight up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After signaling that I was finished, I turned the paper over.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Getting a perfect score on the written exam was the minimum requirement. We were also required to write elegantly and swiftly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was my seventh written exam since turning four, and I had been ranked first four times in a row. In my first written exam, I ranked twenty-fourth place, the second was fifteenth, and the third was seventh, so I didn&apos;t have the best start.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It took some time to understand the mechanism, logic, and efficiency of the written exams.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Once I unraveled it, nobody could surpass me, and I continued to refine my precision.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My gap with second place widened with each written exam, and now I finished about five minutes earlier.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if I completed the exam with a perfect score and finished first, no one would praise me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Once everyone had cleared it, we moved on to the next curriculum.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let&apos;s do judo&#xa0;now. Everyone change&#xa0;and follow&#xa0;the instructor to another room.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Martial arts&#x2014;this was another curriculum added when we started our fourth year here, just like the written exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had been learning judo for four months already.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While being drilled in the basics, I had progressed to the stage where I was doing <em>randori<sup id=\"fnref-2-74ec2a02-77fa-5221-bac5-ebdd332e78e2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-2-74ec2a02-77fa-5221-bac5-ebdd332e78e2\" data-ref=\"2\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[2]</a></sup></em>&#xa0;in actual combat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Haah!!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My vision shook, and intense pain ran through my back.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In confrontations with the instructors, the children were always made to taste bitter defeat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, I was no exception.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Get up!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I couldn&apos;t breathe, having been ruthlessly slammed to the floor, and they wouldn&apos;t let me rest.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If I didn&apos;t immediately stand up, more scoldings and an even stronger blow would come flying at me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Again, I was slammed to the floor, desperately trying to break my fall, but I couldn&apos;t fully absorb the damage.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While I was pinned to the ground, similar scenes were happening around me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Children were writhing around, either crying or sobbing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t&#x2026; stand anymore&#x2026;!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Pleading for mercy, Mikuru weakly clung to the instructor&apos;s leg.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Still, stand up!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She was forcibly shaken off and compelled to stand, but her body seemed unable to move.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The fact that she was female wasn&apos;t taken into consideration at all here.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m telling you to stand up!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Mikuru was kicked away, spinning across the floor while scattering vomit around her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, the adults weren&apos;t serious with their kicks.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yet, it was clear to anyone watching that the strength he used was greater than usual.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t spare even children! You should know that by now!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Normally, people would have a strong resistance against hurting children to this extent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, the instructors called to this White Room weren&apos;t normal.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They were the kind who wouldn&apos;t hesitate to push women and children to the brink of death.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No matter how many of you disappear, no one will cry for you! Stand up on your own and come at me!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With her eyes unfocused, Mikuru tried to get up on her hands, convulsing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s right! Show some spirit!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ugh&#x2026; ugh&#x2026;!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, perhaps due to the severity of the kick earlier, Mikuru collapsed and lost consciousness.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Tch. What a weakling. Get her out of here quickly! She&apos;s in the way!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructor stomped around irritably, forcefully removing Mikuru and shouting angrily.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Would others consider such a scene tragic?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If so, it might be wise for them to reconsider.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was only the beginning. Excessive reactions like Mikuru&apos;s would decrease day by day, and eventually, even their expressions of pain would fade.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The brain would even discard human instincts as unnecessary functions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Being thrown was normal. Breathing difficulties were normal. Hurting so much that one sobbed was normal. And even thinking about such things was a waste of energy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The only way to improve the situation was to keep trying to reduce the number of times you were thrown around within the time limit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, ideally, you would defeat the opponent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, our opponent was overwhelmingly superior in strength, size, and skill.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It went without saying that it wasn&apos;t easy to bridge the gap between children and adults.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After being forced into a harsh fight where all of us were out of breath, we still managed to stand up, battered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After receiving intense lessons from the instructors, we were obligated to engage in <em>randori</em>&#xa0;with three other children&#xa0;at the end of the day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We didn&apos;t show signs of fatigue.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Prey that appeared weak was destined to be hunted by the strong, a lesson we learned.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My total record was 144 fights, 127 wins, and 17 losses. And currently, I was on a four-win streak.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Our opponents were rotated&#xa0;regardless of gender, but standing before me now was Shiro, quietly waiting for the signal to start.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiro&apos;s total record was 135 wins and 9 losses, an overwhelmingly good record.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We had faced each other twice before, with me having both won and lost once.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I lost the first <em>randori</em>&#xa0;match, but ever since the rotation came around again, I hadn&apos;t lost, and he was the best at judo among those learning.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Because he was such a formidable opponent, my senses were sharpened.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiro was usually aggressive and took the initiative in other matches, but today, for our third fight, he seemed to be waiting, aiming for a counter.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For me, this was welcomed&#x2014;I wanted to gain experience attacking against a strong opponent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Begin!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At the instructor&apos;s call, we fought, each of us striving to outdo the other while carrying the weight of defeat on our backs.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whether we won or lost here, we would move on to the next curriculum as if nothing had happened.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Karate was introduced, a martial art that we started a bit later.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Here, the instructors would strike us with more direct blows than in judo.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>As we turn five or six, we&apos;ll probably learn a larger variety of martial arts.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was a common consciousness among all the children.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"43c88498-c709-5852-82a9-d064a0c8cf90\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-43c88498-c709-5852-82a9-d064a0c8cf90\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-43c88498-c709-5852-82a9-d064a0c8cf90\">[1]: </a>Refers to the Latin alphabet.</p></li><li data-id=\"74ec2a02-77fa-5221-bac5-ebdd332e78e2\" data-ref=\"2\" class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-2-74ec2a02-77fa-5221-bac5-ebdd332e78e2\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-2-74ec2a02-77fa-5221-bac5-ebdd332e78e2\">[2]: </a>&quot;Randori,&quot; meaning &quot;free exercise,&quot; in judo refers to one-on-one sparring.</p></li></ol>",
