We&apos;ve found it, the ideal location!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Don&apos;t make such a racket.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Paired with my lack of sleep, it felt like he was shouting through a megaphone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With a ringing in my ears, I reluctantly got up and received the report documents from Kamogawa.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You have a strong alcohol scent. I&apos;m jealous, where did you go to eat something so delicious?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Drinking is part of the job and it&apos;s a part of the series of hardships; I don&apos;t have the nerves to enjoy it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If you thought I was just drinking cheap booze and having fun with the girls, you&apos;d be mistaken.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even as a politician, you couldn&apos;t afford to act high and mighty, constantly bowing to superiors and serving drinks. It was no different from the daily life of a salaryman.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The documents Kamogawa excitedly brought were about the property that would serve as the project&apos;s stage.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Saitama, huh? That&apos;s your hometown, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wasn&apos;t particularly surprised considering how unrealistic it would be to have it in Tokyo, where things are expensive.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. Deep in the mountains, there used to be a pharmaceutical company&apos;s factory. The company saw a decline in sales decades ago after pollution issues were reported; and a few years ago, they went bankrupt. The factory wasn&apos;t demolished and still remains. The size of the property is neither too large nor too small, making it an ideal location for our project.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I placed the documents on the desk and checked the specific location on the computer map.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In this era, being able to access the information I needed in real time from anywhere was truly invaluable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The ideal location was over an hour from the nearest station and couldn&apos;t be reached by bus.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Both the prices for rental and full purchase were listed. Although slightly expensive, it seemed possible to opt for a rental agreement and switch to purchase after a few years.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Well, depending on the negotiations, various terms and amounts could be adjusted.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;However, it seems like they&apos;re taking advantage of us with that 2.4 million price, doesn&apos;t it? There&apos;s a similar place thirty minutes from the station listed at 2.5 million. There seems to be more room for negotiation.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I think they&apos;re just feeling their way at first.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With this location, since it would be hard to find tenants, it wouldn&apos;t be difficult to lead them into a position where they want to offer this place without us having to beg for it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>If it&apos;s a long-term contract, the other party might agree to a significant price reduction.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s a good place, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re quite enthusiastic, but what about the budget for renovations?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Here it is!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He took out another document from his bag and handed it to me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Seems like he at least has the minimum capability to think and put it to use</em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">All the necessary items for the construction seemed to have been accounted for.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was even a 3D model created.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Did you do this?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. I asked someone I know in the construction industry. Of course, I haven&apos;t mentioned this project at all, so don&apos;t worry&#x2026; What do you think?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Not bad. But needless painting and such are completely unnecessary. I have no intention of spending money on making it stylish.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Thorough budget cuts, then.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let&apos;s adjust it again in that direction.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">First, it was about getting the project on track.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, results were also required simultaneously.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well done for now. I want to contact the owner immediately.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What about the intermediary? Shall we skip them?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, since we&apos;re already involving an intermediary, any petty tricks might backfire. It&apos;s better to have them on our side and move forward.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Understood.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While we needed to keep looking for second and third options, I preferred to settle it in one go. The party with the financial world that Sakayanagi arranged was also approaching.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If things go smoothly&#x2026; what about the children? Even if we have the money and facilities, and the educators are ready, it&apos;s useless without the children, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, I was also progressing on that front at the same time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. I have it figured out.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;ve figured it out? Can you be more specific? I&apos;m part of the team, after all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I glared at Kamogawa, who looked at me with hopeful eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The world has things better left unknown. If you learn of these things carelessly, I won&apos;t be able to help you in an emergency. Not only would I no longer be a politician, but are you prepared to spend years, even decades, in prison?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No&#x2026; I definitely don&apos;t want that&#x2026;!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t a threat. In fact, I had started mobilizing a plan that would be instantly doomed if exposed. I couldn&apos;t involve Kamogawa in this matter.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t to protect Kamogawa&#x2014;it was to protect myself. If this guy were taken by the police, it would be impossible for him to escape rigorous interrogation. Moreover&#x2026; he wouldn&apos;t stay silent either.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Anyway, there are plenty of ways to secure children, so don&apos;t worry.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Normally, when a newborn&apos;s parentage couldn&apos;t be determined, they&apos;d be sent to a baby home or child welfare facility through the child consultation center. The process would then move to adoption or finding foster parents.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whether their later lives were happy was unknown, but the only important fact was whether they were provided with a favorable environment. As long as the means to secure newborns were established, there would be no issue with child-rearing institutions getting involved.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It isn&apos;t something I can&apos;t tell you, but it would be nice if there were a simpler and easier way to acquire children. But for now, it&apos;s still difficult. Even if we proceed by the book, strangers&#x2026; even if they know we&apos;re politicians, won&apos;t just hand over children.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is that how it is?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was true that if you strung together pleasing words, like saying they&apos;d receive generous protection and government favor, the mother might willingly hand over her newborn.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, the current situation required me to consider cases where this wouldn&apos;t occur.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Can&apos;t we also consider taking them from orphanages?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There are no orphanages in Japan. To be precise, they&apos;re called child welfare facilities. And for newborns and babies like I&apos;m looking for, it would be a baby home, not a child welfare facility. Though, even they would suspect us. It&apos;s a matter of life and death.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;I see.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If you were someone living an ordinary life, it was no surprise to be indifferent to matters like these.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Until today, Kamogawa must&apos;ve been too busy listing potential facility sites.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course, I intend to approach baby homes too. But that will be after the institution&apos;s operations are on track and it has been officially established as a government-led policy.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, the main plan was to eventually create our own receptacle for children.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We&apos;d either bribe the head of an obstetrics and gynecology clinic or, if that fails, open one.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Finding a doctor willing to sell their soul to the devil wouldn&apos;t be that hard.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I explained things to Kamogawa through the computer screen, showing him the detailed plan.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Creating a place that could serve as a receptacle for mothers who couldn&apos;t raise their children&#x2014;this way, no one had any business interfering.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Babies born from the mother&apos;s womb would be counted as day zero, and those under twenty-eight days old would be called &quot;newborns.&quot; However, we&apos;d secretly take babies up to three months old as well. In exchange for not questioning the mother&apos;s responsibility, we&apos;d make a contract stating that they wouldn&apos;t be able to interact with their child.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Until they reached six months old, their health would be thoroughly managed. Then, an educational program would be implemented.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re preparing to abandon giving the perfect education for the first few years, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t talk nonsense. Whether there&apos;s money or not, starting from the first year, we&apos;ll provide the children with a thorough education. If you think the political and financial world will be moved with half-baked results, you&apos;re naive, Kamogawa.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They also provided elite education to their own children from a young age. Compared to that, if there wasn&apos;t a significant difference in ability, the institution&apos;s credibility would waver.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We had to develop both academic and physical abilities to their highest levels.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The more samples, the better. Whether it&apos;s one or twenty, we&apos;ll accept them all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter how many children broke, if we covered up the reality, it wouldn&apos;t matter.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If ten survived, then we just had ten children from the start.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That would demonstrate the competence of the educational institution.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But can education even be given to infants? They can&apos;t even understand words, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do you know about baby signs?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Baby signs? What&apos;s that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;As you say, infants can&apos;t even speak. Baby signs are gestures designed for communication. While brain development and muscle growth are necessary for learning and handling words, hands and fingers develop much faster.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, acquiring these baby signs would be difficult until about six months old.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Infants are much more intelligent than adults think. If they&apos;re not taught, all they do is cry, but if they learn baby signs, they can tell adults why they&apos;re crying. This project goes beyond that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The ultimate form of early education. From the moment of birth, we would instill intensive education.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was the project&apos;s purpose.</p>",
