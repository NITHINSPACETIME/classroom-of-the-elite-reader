In that green room, I leaned back in a chair, not bothering to hide how exhausted I appeared.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I apologize for how I look. Even I&apos;ve&#xa0;reached my breaking point.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t worry about it. From what it seems, you haven&apos;t had a proper sleep in days, have you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hah&#x2026; you see right through me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji-sensei, you push yourself to the limit without a hint of hesitation. Moreover, now is a critical time for the White Room&apos;s survival. I knew you&apos;d be able to maintain your composure until the end. I truly admire your mental strength.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I gave Sakayanagi a light wave with my hand, telling him to stop flattering me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Tell me why you&apos;re here. You didn&apos;t come just to offer words of comfort, did you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;After discussing things with my father, I&apos;ve happily agreed to become the chairman of the Advanced Nurturing High School soon.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh? So you&apos;re finally stepping onto the center stage. After having seen both sides, you chose to follow in your father&apos;s footsteps in the end. This twist isn&apos;t very surprising, but it&apos;s very like you, Sakayanagi. I&apos;ll sincerely congratulate you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Thank you very much. It&apos;s all thanks to the years I was allowed to study under you, Ayanokouji-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He didn&apos;t seem very happy, which must be tied to the circumstances he was about to discuss.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Now that it was clear he would take over, the reason was obvious.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Being associated with a man like me would pose many problems for you as the chairman of ANHS. It&apos;s a good time to cut ties.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Although our views differ, I&apos;ve always held you in high regards, Ayanokouji-sensei. I was truly surprised when Naoe-sensei turned on you, but it made me realize just how genuine your passion for the White Room is. That&apos;s why&#x2026; it&apos;s regrettable that we must distance ourselves.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a cheesy line, but it was indeed something Sakayanagi would say.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not fixated on the White Room. I am a have-not. If I hadn&apos;t resisted and fought against Naoe, what awaited me would be a future where everything is taken from me. Even if I could survive as a politician, there would be no hope for my rise. Japan is too bound by seniority. No matter how capable you are, being young means being sifted out and dropped. Or if you try to force your way out, power will come to cut you down. But look at the world. It&apos;s not uncommon to see people in their twenties holding significant positions. There are even those in their thirties leading countries.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter how much I suppressed it, ambition endlessly surged within me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;To the old fools with their time ticking away, what&apos;s the point of entrusting them with the political world any longer? They think it&apos;s fine as long as they can spend their remaining time in peace, unconcerned with offering up the country&apos;s flesh and blood to protect their own ten or twenty years. What about thirty years, forty years later? Devoured by other countries, not even the skin and bones of Japan will remain.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If I deemed someone capable, I would employ and master using them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, there might be ambitious fellows who might stab me in the back or those secretly acting on someone else&apos;s orders, but if they were capable, I would employ them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Otherwise, the political world&apos;s polluted blood wouldn&apos;t change, and it would remain stagnant forever.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Fighting to protect your own position brought no benefit to the country.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Indeed, that&apos;s something I&apos;ve also wondered about. Only in their sixties or seventies do they finally get qualified to lead the country. I fully understand why you find that suspicious, Ayanokouji-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I have to solidify the White Room and send personnel capable of overhauling the country&apos;s organizational structure. Then, I plan to overturn that system from the ground up.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if it seemed like a pipe dream, I would definitely accomplish it in the end.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s a grand plan. It might take more than ten or twenty years.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I know. It might be impossible to change everything in my generation. That&apos;s why I also need people who will inherit the White Room. It&apos;s crucial to create an &apos;educator&apos; who can produce even more perfect humans.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There were already children who were starting to exceed the limits of the curriculum Suzukake created.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;However, if possible, I&apos;d rather stand at the forefront myself. My ambition has never waned. Once someone has opposed an individual with great power, it&apos;s nearly impossible to return to the front lines. As long as Naoe is in the Citizens&apos; Party, a place for me will never be prepared.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve heard you&apos;ve had several offers from the opposing party.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You sure know the ins and outs. Indeed, I have a lot of information. The opposing party would desperately want someone like me. However, joining them would only mean being used. Unless the situation changes, I have no choice but to wait. My fight starts from there. I have to build up strength to get elected. By then, the people above me, my obstacles, would either be dead or retired and living in seclusion.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It really is an exhausting tale.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having experienced both success and failure, I had a firm conviction within me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t to imitate the successful.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If imitating successful people led to success, no one would struggle.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>So what should I do?</em>&#xa0;It was to avoid doing what unsuccessful people did.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Most of the world consisted of unsuccessful people. I watched them and made sure not to repeat their mistakes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This view was crucial&#x2014;though it might&apos;ve seemed similar, it was fundamentally different.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Good luck, Sakayanagi. Let&apos;s meet again someday.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I shook hands with him, bidding him a temporary farewell.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, after seeing Sakayanagi off at the entrance, I quietly gazed at the cityscape below by myself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In this world, there&apos;s a saying called &quot;merits and demerits.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It meant strengths and weaknesses. It was a convenient phrase that included both the good and the bad.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Many well-known politicians were associated with this saying, &quot;merits and demerits,&quot; and it suited them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">On the surface, they succeeded in executing various reforms, but on the flip side, they greatly enriched themselves.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The problem was that these merits and demerits were never equal.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From others&apos; perspectives, ten merits were overshadowed by five demerits.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In other words, if you saved ten people but let five die, you were considered evil.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was what the masses would say.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Save ten people, and don&apos;t allow anyone to be unhappy.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Save a hundred people, and don&apos;t allow anyone to be unhappy.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Even if you save a thousand people, if you make one person unhappy, you&apos;re evil.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was the psychology of the masses.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, a minority would say, &quot;Since you saved 1000 people, I&apos;ll turn a blind eye to a small sacrifice.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, there was another trick here&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>The voices of those who criticize are invariably loud.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If about ten percent of the population voiced their criticism, the media would gleefully pick up those critical voices.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And then they&apos;d create the illusion that the entire country was criticizing them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">People were more attracted to the idea of criticizing people than praising them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Just wait. One day, I&apos;ll surely stand at the top of this country.&quot;</p>",
