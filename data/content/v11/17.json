Four months. Even in the Reiwa Era, nothing has changed. I’m still your Kinugasa. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Volume 11 is done, and now, the first-year story arc has reached its conclusion. The students have safely made it to the closing ceremony, but we have a spring vacation story to tell before we get to the second-year. I’m planning for that book to be a story focused on the year in review, essentially, covering how the students have changed over the past year and how they’ll continue to change. Also… there might be some romantic developments. But </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">who</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">?!</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">At any rate, now that I’ve finished the story arc for the first year, I just want to say, straight out…there ain’t enough pages! I originally planned for Volumes 10 and 11 to be combined into one book, but that just ended up being totally impossible, right? Once I started writing, the page count just kept increasing and increasing. There were so many things that I couldn’t even fit in two volumes!</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">When I start a new book, I’m always thinking to myself, </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Ugh, maaaan, how in the heck do I get this started? And how do I fill three hundred pages?!</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> But, before I even know it, it’s like </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">The heck?! There’s only a couple pages left?! </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I feel like this keeps happening more and more… Which is why I’m thinking I’ll carry over some of the extra things I wrote and put them in Volume 11.5. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Anyhow, let’s have a little chat. On the rare occasions that I do meet someone who works in the industry, they usually tell me something like, “I have no idea what you’re usually up to! Please get on social media!” Years ago, I pretty much had no choice but to do some blogging and such related to my work. But I guess, well…it’s not that I&#160;don’t </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">like</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> it, it’s like I’m just really bad at it. So I thought that just giving updates in the postscripts of my books might be perfect for me. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">As for what I usually do, well—I work, and I play golf once in a while. But I don’t actually go to the golf course or anything (I’m bad at golf, it’s not cheap, I have no endurance). I just hit balls at the driving range for about an hour or so and then I’m done. But that’s enough to leave me satisfied. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even if I did use social media, I’m sure I’d just be posting super dull stuff like that. So I guess I’ll end my postscripts in a super boring way, too! See you again next time!</span></p>\n",
