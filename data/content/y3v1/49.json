It was because Horikita had stopped cooking and abandoned her duty of supporting and maintaining her, the cash-strapped Ibuki&apos;s, stomach&apos;s peace and stability.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Regardless of whether Ibuki visited her room or called her, she received no proper response.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And today, Class A had been defeated in the special exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While this was good news for Ibuki&apos;s class, personally, she couldn&apos;t honestly be happy about it. Horikita would only become more dejected.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">So, who knew when Horikita would be able to provide meals for her again?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Why do I have to act so considerate?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was after school. Growing irritated with Horikita, who hadn&apos;t emerged from the school building, Ibuki paced back and forth near the entrance, waiting. Once she came out, she&apos;d give her a sharp stimulus to cheer her up, and then make her cook.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Such one-sided thoughts ran laps inside her mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But no matter how long she waited, there was no sign of Horikita coming out.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She&apos;d gone to check the shoe lockers once, but Horikita&apos;s shoes were still there, so she hadn&apos;t gone home.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Come out already. How concerned do you plan to make&#x2026; no, no, I&apos;m not concerned.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When a strange emotion surfaced, she pushed it out of her mind. Her thoughts were getting weird because she hadn&apos;t eaten anything delicious for a while. That was her conclusion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After that, perhaps another thirty minutes of going back and forth in the same place&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah&#x2026; she&apos;s coming out.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Horikita, whom she&apos;d been waiting for, finally emerged from the school building.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She looked lifeless from behind, and as expected, Ibuki couldn&apos;t feel a speck of spirit or vigor.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"/><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&apos;You shouldn&apos;t kick anyone, but if you absolutely must kick someone, then I suppose there&#x2019;s no other choice than to find someone who would enjoy being kicked or someone who would benefit from being kicked. If such an odd person exists, that is.&apos;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"/><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As she stared at her back, Ibuki remembered what Katsuragi had once told her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">By the time she recalled it, she was already running on impulse.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The only thing she could do right now&#x2014;that is, to deliver a merciless kick to Horikita&apos;s back.</p>",
