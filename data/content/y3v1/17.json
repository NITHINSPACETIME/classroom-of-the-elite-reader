Let&apos;s pass on that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto seemed serious about having the welcome party, and we continued together to the exit, escaping the gazes directed at us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Man, your boldness is something else&#x2026; I never imagined you&apos;d plan to transfer to our class. And to think you used my money for it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How many times have you complained about that? You seem really displeased.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The conversation about the transfer was still fresh for Hashimoto, but he brought it up every chance he got.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, of course, I&apos;d have my thoughts about it. Money is a precious insurance for me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto had obtained a large sum of money by moving in all sorts of directions and even betraying Sakayanagi.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wouldn&apos;t be surprising if he felt a great deal of frustration if he had to spit out most of that money.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you could go back to before you had to decide on my transfer, would you want to cancel it, Hashimoto?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s&#x2026; honestly, it would be a lie to say I wouldn&apos;t hesitate.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Right. There might&apos;ve been a future where you could&#x2019;ve saved twenty million private points on your own.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto chuckled softly at these words and nodded without denying it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Saving that amount on his own would be a difficult endeavor, but achieving it would almost guarantee graduating from Class A.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was why it took courage and resolve to give up that dream.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;To graduate from Class A, you have to take the appropriate risks.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Tell me about it. In these past two years, I&apos;ve crossed many dangerous bridges on my own, participating in the conflict between Sakayanagi and Katsuragi, pairing up Ryuuen and Katsuragi on the deserted island, and most recently, taking a stand against Sakayanagi. I&apos;ve been stacking up indescribable efforts and continuously producing results.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto talked about his own proactive actions as if they were someone else&apos;s business.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, those moves certainly had risks.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then you should think positively. Your efforts to take on those risks have borne fruit, and you&apos;ve successfully pulled me into your class. That&apos;s undoubtedly an accomplishment.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, yeah.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Still, it&apos;s understandable that Hashimoto couldn&apos;t purely rejoice or be optimistic.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter how much Hashimoto valued me, his current class was Class C.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since he decided to go through with a transfer in the first place, he would&apos;ve had a higher chance of victory if he simply went to Horikita&apos;s class himself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Or he could transfer to Ryuuen&apos;s class with me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Either of those options would&apos;ve been easier to understand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, it was precisely because I could see through that thought process that I presented Hashimoto with two choices.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>To either give up his fortune and accept me, or to give up on accepting me altogether.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If he refused, no cooperative relationship would emerge between us until graduation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If he ended up having to deal with his own class antagonizing him, on top of bearing an adversary-like relationship with me for a year, there would be nothing guaranteeing his safety. Even Ryuen could bare his fangs at any moment..</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He weighed which choice would increase his chances of winning.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s fine to trust you on that, right, Ayanokouji? That from here on, you&apos;ll seriously aim for Class A. I&#xa0;plan to make you stand out even if you don&apos;t want to, okay?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto voiced his wishful thinking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He must&apos;ve thought he had every right to make such a claim.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, Hashimoto&apos;s contributions significantly lowered the hurdle for the transfer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But that didn&apos;t mean I could easily fulfill his wishes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I told you when we talked about the transfer. I won&apos;t guarantee anything when making decisions. You just have to decide whether you believe in me or not.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Whether I intend to rise to Class A</em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if I was willing to strive toward that premise, I never shared how we&apos;d get to Class A, let alone strategies or even the prospects.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was why when it came down to making decisions regarding his plan of action, Hashimoto wasn&apos;t able to come up with an immediate reply, and still had lingering doubts.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto, who antagonized Sakayanagi, and who ultimately contributed to her voluntary withdrawal.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Not all Class C students knew everything, but there were certainly those who were wary and disliked Hashimoto. It was by no means a comfortable class. If trouble were to come, he was the first in position to be discarded.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Remaining in that class and inviting me, who had no guarantee of being useful, was a big risk.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s right&#x2026; Ah, I know that well.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Despite harboring many uncertainties, Hashimoto ultimately decided to accept me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Instead of the ideal of using twenty million Private Points right before graduation to guarantee Class A, he chose another ideal: teaming up with me to become Class A and graduate on his own.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No, he concluded that it wasn&apos;t an ideal but a reality.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sure, I accepted the conditions. But if you have plans for the future, you could share a little with me. That&apos;s what being comrades is about.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even when I spoke as if I was pushing him away, Hashimoto valiantly continued.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What to do&#x2026; I&apos;m worried about being betrayed like Sakayanagi.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey, stop with the bad jokes, Ayanokouji. I&apos;m all in on you, literally penniless. What&apos;s the point of betraying now!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto, perhaps flustered, gestured and insisted on his innocence as he moved in front of me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Still, knowing you, Hashimoto, aren&apos;t you scheming something, not even&#xa0;a little here or there?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, no, no, definitely not. It&apos;s fine for others to doubt me, but please, spare me from your suspicions.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, I wasn&apos;t really concerned about whether Hashimoto would betray us in the future.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Keeping a bit of tension was probably just right for Hashimoto.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, I might&apos;ve said too much. Without your cooperation, transferring to Class C wouldn&apos;t have been easy. Let&apos;s properly discuss the strategy, no, the future plans.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Really, you should&apos;ve been straightforward from the beginning.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I took out my phone and confirmed that I&#x2019;d received a reply.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>It might be better to take Hashimoto to the upcoming meeting.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m heading to Keyaki Mall now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not that you&apos;re asking for a welcome party, but rather, you&apos;re sharing your plans there, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I nodded in affirmation, Hashimoto nodded back, satisfied.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;By the way&#x2026; what about you, Morishita?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I turned around and called out to Morishita, who must&apos;ve been watching us from the shadows.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The girl who should&apos;ve left the classroom earlier showed herself from behind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re doing it, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka. You don&apos;t have a popular&#xa0;presence, but you seem sensitive to the presence of people.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps it was a pun using the same kanji for &apos;&#x4eba;&#x6c17;<sup id=\"fnref-1-5483a848-158c-5f63-acc8-5de8f32e43cc\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-5483a848-158c-5f63-acc8-5de8f32e43cc\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup>&apos; (&apos;popularity&apos; and &apos;human presence&apos;).</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This time, I felt I understood the meaning, unlike the previous joke about having a hundred friends.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So you were interested after all. What happened to the adventure you mentioned?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The truth that is now revealed&#x2014;<em>this is the adventure</em>. The sudden appearance of the embodiment of unpopularity, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, and the embodiment of betrayal, Hashimoto Masayoshi. If interacting with these two isn&apos;t an adventure, what is?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Like I said, I&apos;m&#x2026; Ah, never mind. It&apos;s a waste of time to correct you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It seems you finally admit that you are a traitor.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, yeah. Is it okay for you to be in contact with such a traitor? You just rejected the welcome party.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not like I&apos;m attending the party. It&apos;s only natural as a classmate to discuss the future of Class C early on. You&apos;ll probably meet Ichinose Honami after this, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Morishita smirked as she touched on the topic of our plans after this.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ichinose? Why is her name coming up here?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hehe, so the traitor isn&apos;t trusted after all. It seems you&apos;re not informed about even the most basic of knowledge regarding future plans.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto&apos;s smile stiffened slightly as if provoked.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t tell me you&apos;ve already talked to Morishita?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&apos;<em>I&apos;m cooperating the most, but you intend on just pushing me to the side?</em>&apos; It was clear he was thinking along the lines of such a question.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For this transfer, Class C&apos;s unanimous consent was a must. There were things I couldn&apos;t entrust to you and your problematic issues. Unlike you, who trusts me, Morishita has strong doubts, so it was necessary to provide her with appropriate information.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, I sort of get what you&apos;re saying&#x2026; but it&apos;s hard to accept that I lost to Morishita. Well, if I can hear about it later, I can accept it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto sighed. Believing that standing and talking any further was a waste, he took the lead and started walking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I started walking a bit later, and Morishita lined up beside me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What are you planning?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You already know the plan, and there was no need for you to be here today.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From the fact that she&#x2019;d been secretly following us, it seemed she&#x2019;d been considering joining from the start.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;As for you, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, that might be true. However, Ichinose Honami is different. I can&apos;t judge whether the good-natured Class D will be of any use until I see it with my own eyes. At least, if she remains the leader I know, I have low expectations.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was some degree of trust in Ichinose&apos;s abilities, but it wasn&apos;t enough for them to entirely rely upon her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her strength also encompassed her weakness.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Morishita thought about it; if expressed in simple terms, Ichinose was an unreliable leader.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">So, there was a reason to attend and verify whether it made sense to collaborate.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then, observe sharply like a great detective. There are no restrictions.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That goes without saying.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Afterward, the three of us headed to the cafe, the prearranged meeting location with Ichinose</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"5483a848-158c-5f63-acc8-5de8f32e43cc\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-5483a848-158c-5f63-acc8-5de8f32e43cc\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-5483a848-158c-5f63-acc8-5de8f32e43cc\">[1]: </a>Some kanji can be read in different ways; in this case, &quot;&#x4eba;&#x6c17;&quot; can both mean &quot;popularity&quot; (pronounced as <em>ninki</em>) or &quot;human presence&quot; (pronounced <em>hitoke</em>). And yes, the parenthesis here is actually&#xa0;in the raw.</p></li></ol>",
