You worried about something?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou, who had taken the seat diagonally behind her, asked with a hint of concern.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I haven&#x2019;t seen Ayanokouji-kun since the opening ceremony ended. It&#x2019;s already time for class, and he&#x2019;s still not here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just like usual, everyone was present in the classroom&#x2014;except Ayanokouji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even though there were no classes after this today, this was a time when his presence was mandatory. The school would check for unexcused tardies. Horikita understood from past experiences that a single absence wouldn&apos;t result in a significant deduction of class points, but it was the first day for Class 3-A. And unlike Sudou and Ike who had histories of being late, an absence from Ayanokouji, who preferred not to stand out, was troubling.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Come to think of it, yeah. Though, I&apos;m pretty sure he looked normal when we left the gym?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou muttered, glancing up as he recalled the memory that occurred less than thirty minutes ago.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Horikita had exchanged a few words with Ayanokouji that morning when they became desk&#xa0;neighbors, and nothing unusual had happened then.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe he&apos;s got a stomachache and is holed up in the bathroom?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, it&apos;s not impossible.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Despite feeling a bit uncomfortable with the indelicate suggestion, it was still a plausible explanation to consider.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Still, something didn&apos;t sit right with her, and Sudou, as if remembering something, crossed his arms and gave a deep nod.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe he&apos;s pretending to be sick.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After speaking, Sudou let out a wry smile, imagining something unexpected.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Feigning sickness? Why would you think that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When Horikita questioned him about his unexpected reasoning, Sudou lowered his voice by about two notches and started whispering.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He and Karuizawa recently broke up, right? It must be pretty awkward to face each other.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s no reason to feign sickness&#x2014;and he was normal this morning.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe when he actually came to school, it hit him like a body blow<sup id=\"fnref-1-b6ad045c-3a8a-59c5-b2e4-d114127d5319\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-b6ad045c-3a8a-59c5-b2e4-d114127d5319\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup>? For me too, you know, when I experienced heartbreak, it really took a toll on me mentally.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He looked into Horikita&apos;s eyes, but then, feeling somewhat embarrassed, he averted his gaze.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou, who had confessed to Horikita during last year&apos;s school trip, was speaking from personal experience. Horikita also thought back to Sudou&apos;s feelings at that time. Indeed, there was a certain awkwardness.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Is that how it is?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although she didn&apos;t consider herself superior in matters of love, the unavoidable reality was that there were people who dumped others and those who got dumped themselves.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For Horikita, who still lacked knowledge and experience in love, it was somewhat difficult to comprehend.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou, seeing Horikita&apos;s complex expression, hurriedly scratched his head.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey, I&apos;m fine now. But, you know, Ayanokouji might also have a surprisingly delicate side to him. Being in a relationship with someone from within the same class and then breaking up with them can be quite troublesome, you know? Look, even Karuizawa seemed&#xa0;to be blatantly avoiding Ayanokouji since this morning.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Before spring break and up till the end of the third term, Horikita recalled the two having a closeness that only intimate lovers could have, a sense of distance that made it difficult for a third party to approach.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, this morning in the classroom, neither of them took even a single step to close the distance between each other.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t just physically, but emotionally as well.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She reconsidered, realizing that it might indeed be true that human relationships became somewhat complicated when romance was involved.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I understand what you&apos;re saying, but weren&apos;t both of them prepared for that when they started dating?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She had no intention whatsoever of meddling in the affairs between girls and guys, but as a matter of fact, not everyone could part amicably. She muttered that they must&apos;ve been aware of the risks.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s not true. No one starts dating with the assumption that they&apos;ll break up, right? I hear stories from my kouhai&#xa0;about how they started dating, leading up to their breakup. Now, they&apos;re struggling because they can&apos;t figure out the right distance to keep between them, you know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Horikita, trying not to be noticed, stole glances at Karuizawa, who was sitting in a seat near the back by the window. With a somewhat listless appearance, she was gazing out the window.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;d hope for them to manage at least this little&#xa0;bit of risk&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if that were true, it was a separate issue. Being uncomfortable and thus absent or late was not something to condone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But&#x2026; still, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a very high likelihood either way.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whether it was stomach pain or the shock of being dumped, <em>Ayanokouji&apos;s demeanor remained the same as usual</em>, she once again concluded.&#xa0;While it was entirely possible that he simply had a poker face and was skillfully hiding behind it, she could hardly imagine him being the type of person to do such a thing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, it&apos;s just a possibility. Cut him some slack if he&apos;s a bit late.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Once is okay. But if it happens repeatedly, as a class, we can&apos;t just ignore it. Alright. Whatever the case, we&apos;ll understand when the time comes.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Horikita decided that, no matter the truth, it was unlikely for Ayanokouji to disappear from school without notice.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"b6ad045c-3a8a-59c5-b2e4-d114127d5319\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-b6ad045c-3a8a-59c5-b2e4-d114127d5319\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-b6ad045c-3a8a-59c5-b2e4-d114127d5319\">[1]: </a>In this context, a &quot;body blow,&quot; also known as a &quot;body shot,&quot; refers to the boxing term when punching an opponent in the torso.</p></li></ol>",
