Because of this, normally, saving money shouldn&#x2019;t be difficult.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, Ibuki had a tendency to spend everything she got without thinking of the consequences, and as a result, she was always tight on finances. That was precisely why, recalling how the time she&#x2019;d been looking forward to was ruined, her irritation began to build up again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While Private Points would be replenished with each new month, naturally, it was always a struggle when she got to the end of each month.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>How would I get through today, how would I get through tomorrow</em>&#x2014;she was forced to confront this sort of battle.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>If only the movie had been satisfying&#x2014;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The emotions she tried to suppress started bubbling up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ahh, this is so annoying.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>How should I alleviate my annoyance?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Harboring this sentiment, what Ibuki found was a certain object.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That being, a trash can placed in &#xa0;Keyaki Mall.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She approached it without concern for the people around and kicked it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She thought kicking it would make her feel a little better after all.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though it wobbled, since it contained more trash than she&#x2019;d expected, it didn&#x2019;t fall over.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was also because it was somewhat of a half-hearted kick; it wasn&apos;t weak, but it wasn&apos;t strong either.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Are you trying to irritate me too?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if mocking her, the trash can only slightly shifted in position, standing there with a faux innocent look.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The action Ibuki thought would help her vent actually had the opposite effect.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What started as just wanting to kick it shifted to wanting to knock it over.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If she could dramatically spill its contents, she&apos;d surely feel better.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You little&#x2014;!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This time, stronger, faster than before.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She imagined the trash can as someone she disliked.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She was about to deliver a kick with enough force such that Ayanokouji would definitely be knocked over&#x2026; or rather, knock the trash can over.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What are you doing, Ibuki?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;!?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just before she completed the motion, a somewhat angry male voice reached her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her body froze, and she turned toward the voice.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There stood Katsuragi with his arms crossed, frowning with a puzzled expression.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why are you here&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you mean, &apos;why&apos;? There&apos;s nothing strange about me walking around Keyaki Mall on my day off, is there?&#x201d;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, that&apos;s true, but&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You seem pretty irritated from what I can see, but I can&#x2019;t say kicking trash cans is very commendable. If you don&#x2019;t strive to act with moderation, it won&#x2019;t benefit our class.&#x201d;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you mean &apos;benefit our class&apos;? What&apos;s the big deal if I kick a trash can over a little?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She displayed an attitude indicating she didn&apos;t think she did anything wrong.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In response, Katsuragi slightly closed the distance between them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you engage in behavior unbecoming of a student and the school discovers it, you&#x2019;ll receive a negative evaluation. Whether it&apos;s a weekday, weekend, or even spring break, the consequences remain the same. I thought you&#x2019;d have more than sufficiently learned that during these two years.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Acting so high and mighty&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;High and mighty? I wasn&apos;t being high and mighty. I merely stated common sense, decency expected of a student. Besides, Ibuki, you&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As Katsuragi began his lengthy lecture, Ibuki didn&#x2019;t even try to conceal her tongue-clicking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The feeling that she had been caught by a troublesome person began to dominate her thoughts.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Seeing how Katauragi continued to ramble on, Ibuki interrupted him with a wave of her hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes, yes. I was wrong, okay, okay. Then, bye&#x2026; &quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if to run away, Ibuki began walking and attempted to pass by Katsuragi, but then she was grabbed by the arm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The trash can didn&apos;t fall over, but it&apos;s out of position. You need to fix that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Haa? So what about its position? As if anyone cares about that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;At the very least, I care. And the fact that I care means the school might care as well.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Saying this, Katsuragi pointed at a surveillance camera.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re seriously such a stickler. The school isn&apos;t watching us all the time, much less at a place like this. Or rather, who cares about the position of a trash can?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course, I would hope that&apos;s the case. However, it&apos;s better safe than sorry.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As Katsuragi spoke, he brought Ibuki back to the trash can.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;How ridiculous.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With the desire to be released quickly taking priority, Ibuki reluctantly picked up the trash can.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There, is this good enough?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, it&apos;s not. The original position was about twenty centimeters more to the right.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Haaa?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;About twenty centimeters more to the right.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi repeated what he said, instructing her to return the trash can to its proper place.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although Ibuki was getting irritated again, she lifted the trash can with an exasperated sigh and moved it about twenty centimeters.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is. This. Okay. Now!?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. Well, this should be good enough.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Satisfied, Katsuragi turned toward the surveillance camera and gave a slight bow.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you stupid?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though these words involuntarily escaped from her mouth at his overly courteous behavior, Katsuragi was unbothered and began walking away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ibuki was about to watch him leave, but there was something she was caught up on.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Haven&apos;t you already accomplished your goal?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Goal?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sakayanagi lost to Ryuuen and dropped out of school. There&#x2019;s no need for you to be so eager anymore, is there?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;I see. Certainly, that was one of my goals. However, I would&apos;ve preferred accomplishing it with my own hands though&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi stopped, folded his arms, and reflected on the end-of-year special exam by himself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But that doesn&apos;t mean my goals have disappeared. There&#x2019;s also my goal to graduate from Class A.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So you want those privileges too, huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Naturally. Those who don&apos;t desire such privileges are probably in the minority. However, that isn&apos;t the only important thing. Not just me on my own, but winning Class A with all of our classmates&#x2014;that&apos;s what&apos;s critical.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi wasn&apos;t originally in Ryueen&#x2019;s class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In fact, the time they spent as adversaries was still slightly longer than their current relationship.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But right now, he answered without any embarrassment that he was thinking about his current class more than anyone else. At this demeanour, Ibuki felt it was a false goodwill, in other words, it was faux benevolence<sup id=\"fnref-1-0a7731ae-fa81-5a95-b377-0ef302a62099\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-0a7731ae-fa81-5a95-b377-0ef302a62099\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you serious?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course, I&apos;m serious.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In other words, it wasn&apos;t sanctimonious.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He firmly answered that he currently had the resolve to move forward with Ryueen and the class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is that why you&apos;re going around teaching those idiots how to study?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The expression, &apos;Going around teaching,&apos; isn&apos;t quite accurate. I also respond to their requests for help; there&apos;s that too. I can&apos;t leave people like that alone. It&apos;s in my nature, you see.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So if someone asks for help, you&apos;ll help them?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well&#x2026; I suppose there&apos;s no harm in putting it that way.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then let me kick you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t understand what you mean.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s exactly what it sounds like. I&apos;m feeling incredibly irritated right now, so I&#x2019;m really itching to kick something, you see.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What a troublesome personality. However, unfortunately, I&apos;m not inclined to let you kick me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then who should I kick?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You shouldn&apos;t kick anyone, but if you absolutely must kick someone, then I suppose there&#x2019;s no other choice than to find someone who would enjoy being kicked or someone who would benefit from being kicked. If such an odd person exists, that is.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see&#x2026; well, that makes sense.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Apart from that, if there&apos;s anything else I can help you with, I&apos;m willing to lend a hand.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hmm&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Setting aside whether Katsuragi&apos;s actions were benevolent or faux benevolent, it was unmistakable that he was considerate and looked after people.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having reached this peculiar conclusion, Ibuki made a proposal.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then buy me a meal.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How did we go from kicking and not kicking to this?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You said you&apos;d help me, right? I&apos;m in trouble &apos;cause I don&apos;t have any money. Look.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She displayed her Private Points balance on her phone screen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;You should have more than this even when you entered school.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&#x2019;m bragging, but I&#x2019;m seriously broke.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t brag about that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So with that said, feed me something. Eating something delicious should help release my stress.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see, I understand.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Katsuragi folded his arms, gave a nod, then opened his eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I refuse.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Wait, why? Aren&apos;t you supposed to extend a helping hand to troubled classmates?!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Only if they&apos;re truly troubled.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Come on, I&apos;m genuinely troubled. I have almost no Private Points left!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you&apos;re broke, you can eat the wild plants set. The school provides proper relief measures. It&apos;s not like you&apos;re in a state where you can&apos;t eat anything. Besides, your Private Points will be replenished in April. I don&apos;t see any need for me to help at this point.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Faced with Katsuragi&apos;s frank attitude, Ibuki glared at him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But I want to eat something better.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then from next month onward, you should straighten yourself up and learn how to save a little.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I already am saving here. It&#x2019;s just that girls have various expenses&#x2014;it can&#x2019;t be helped.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She made an excuse that didn&apos;t apply to her at all&#xa0;to dodge the issue.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see. Then, as a man, there&apos;s not much I can help with. You should seek advice from another woman who knows how to save money.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If she could ask such a person for advice, she wouldn&apos;t be struggling in the first place.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She tried to argue back, but Katsuragi had already started walking away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She regretted even momentarily thinking that he might&apos;ve been considerate and looked after people.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s with him&#x2026;? Ah jeez, getting angry made me hungry&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After glaring at him until his back disappeared from view, Ibuki held her stomach.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Gonna go home&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Deciding there was no point in staying at Keyaki Mall, she immediately returned to the dormitory.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"0a7731ae-fa81-5a95-b377-0ef302a62099\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-0a7731ae-fa81-5a95-b377-0ef302a62099\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-0a7731ae-fa81-5a95-b377-0ef302a62099\">[1]: </a>The raw is &#x507d;&#x308a;&#x306e;&#x5584;&#x610f;&#x3001;&#x3064;&#x307e;&#x308a;&#x507d;&#x5584;, which is somewhat wordplay. The former, &quot;&#x507d;&#x308a;&#x306e;&#x5584;&#x610f;,&quot; which is translated here as &quot;false goodwill,&quot; is literally just stating the definition of &quot;&#x507d;&#x5584;&quot; (notice how both these characters are in the former). &quot;&#x507d;&#x5584;&quot; also often gets translated as &quot;hypocrisy,&quot; but that&apos;s not accurate, and it doesn&apos;t capture the word&apos;s meaning well, which is why it&apos;s translated as &quot;faux belevolence&quot; here.</p></li></ol>",
