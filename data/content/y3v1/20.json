You can take your time if there&apos;s a lot to talk about.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sensing that the person had no ill intent, Hashimoto smiled and pressed the elevator button.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The student waited for Hashimoto to board the elevator and then spoke calmly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Would you mind changing the location a bit? It seems like people might gather here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m fine with it as long as you don&#x2019;t mind. Shall we go to my room, Yousuke?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Outside might be better.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To accommodate his wish, Yousuke and I left the lobby and tried to move away from the dorm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, being alone with just Hirata wasn&apos;t so easy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was evening, and everyone was returning home. It was inevitable that we ran into several students from Horikita&#x2019;s class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hirata&#x2026; Ayanokouji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Taken aback, Sudou muttered our names.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Beside him were Ike and, in an unusual combination, Keisei and Akito.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I just met Suzune and heard a bit of the situation... Rather than transferring to Class C for some strategy, you seriously did it on your own free will?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was unclear whether Horikita had yet to return to the dorm or had already gone back earlier.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah. Sorry.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why did you do it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou, showing a pained expression, tried to approach me when Yousuke intervened.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sudou-kun. If we keep talking here, more and more people will gather.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s&#x2026; right, sorry.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you have something to say, I&apos;m willing to listen. Let&apos;s change the location for now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I agreed with Yousuke and responded to Sudou. Afterward, we ended up going around to the back of the dormitory.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Not only Sudou, but the other three also followed without a hint of hesitation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Soon after moving to a blind spot from the dormitory entrance, Sudou, unable to hold back any longer, spoke up again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why the hell did you do that, Ayanokouji? Why did you transfer classes? There&apos;s no need to go down to Class C after finally moving up to Class A, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Haha, was it because of Karuizawa after all?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t meant to be a joke, but that slipped out of Ike&apos;s mouth.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey Ike&#x2026;!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Come on. I can&apos;t think of any other reason. It must be embarrassing to be dumped.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That might be one of the reasons.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;See! I knew&#x2014;ack!?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ike, clapping his hands in joy, was hit with Sudou&apos;s angry slap on the back.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s definitely a lie, that&apos;s for sure.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ouch&#x2026; He admitted it himself, so assuming it&apos;s a lie is what&apos;s really questionable here if you ask me&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While rubbing his sore back, Ike glared at Sudou and furrowed his brows.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So, what&apos;s the real reason?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Akito asked with a tone that showed he held back some of his anger.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Answering that question was simple, but there were plenty of reasons why it couldn&apos;t be done.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A reason? I don&apos;t see any meaning in answering that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There is meaning. Do you know how we feel right now? I was just with Haruka, and she was feeling really down. She kept repeating over and over that it might&apos;ve been her fault&#x2014;that maybe her attempt to reconcile so conveniently became a burden for you, Kiyotaka.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Come to think of it, I had a chance to talk with Hasebe before the end-of-year special exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, it wouldn&apos;t be surprising to think the remarks exchanged then had influenced me to transfer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;She&apos;s been troubled even before today&apos;s events. Kiyotaka, you&apos;ve helped her, and she hasn&apos;t even been able to properly express her gratitude.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Keisei nodded to Akito&apos;s plea.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I was once saved by you too, Ayanokouji-kun. If it weren&apos;t for you, I probably wouldn&apos;t have stayed at this school.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yousuke seemed to have similar thoughts.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yousuke, who feared people getting hurt, had been wounded by his three classmates&apos; expulsions. It was undeniable that without my support, he would&apos;ve fallen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s why I respected your strength and found you a reliable classmate. But during the unanimous special exam and the end-of-year special exam, there were things I couldn&apos;t digest, no, couldn&apos;t accept. Of course, I won&apos;t deny that it would&apos;ve been better if I had more strength, but I also came to distrust you a bit.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At the end of our spring break, even at the victory celebration Horikita planned, Yousuke showed a hint of those nuanced feelings.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since then, it&#x2019;d been slightly on my mind that he wasn&apos;t calling me by my first name, and considering that he&#x2019;d been maintaining that stance today as well, it might&apos;ve meant he unconsciously wanted to keep a distance between us. Similarly, I&#x2019;d also been intentionally distinguishing between using his first and last name due to the changes in our relationship.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not just Sudou-kun and the others here. Everyone in the class is very worried and confused.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Everyone present wanted to know the reason.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was because they wanted to extract some sort of statement where I admitted there were unavoidable circumstances for the transfer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Worry and confusion, huh? Well, that&apos;s right. I transferred classes without telling anyone to get that reaction.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps his brain refused to comprehend for a moment. Keisei adjusted his glasses and asked to hear it again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Just take it at face value. I didn&apos;t say anything because I wanted to trouble the class. And my reason that you wanted to hear is simple. Class C was in trouble without Sakayanagi. So, I chose to help by transferring in exchange for Private Points.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>A contrived act.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>And for selfish reasons.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I emphasized that the transfer was solely for my own benefit. Even if there were some lies mixed in, it was the undeniable truth.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Wha&#x2026; Are you serious&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Those were Sudou&apos;s words, but Akito and Keisei probably felt the same.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They showed similar reactions to my cold words.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, Yousuke was almost unfazed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey, I&apos;ve been wondering since this morning, but why would that happen?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In the tense atmosphere, Ike tilted his neck&#xa0;and brought his hands to the back of his head.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I get that it&apos;s a pinch without Sakayanagi, but why pay a huge sum of twenty million to poach Ayanokouji? It doesn&apos;t make any sense. I can see that it&apos;s to weaken Class A, but normally, there would be plenty of other students they&apos;d want, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was a question that seemed obvious given the situation. Excluding Yousuke and Sudou, no one there could truly understand why I was the one being bought.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I also thought so at first too. That&apos;s why I was concerned that there might&apos;ve been something behind the transfer. You really aren&apos;t willing to tell us the full story?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Keisei, while agreeing with Ike, wanted to know whether there were any hidden circumstances behind the transfer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There&apos;s nothing more to say. What I just said is everything there is. It&apos;s difficult to prove at this point whether Class C had a good reason to go through such lengths to acquire me. Though, I believe it&apos;s only a matter of time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No matter how you look at it&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as Ike was about to interject, Sudou stepped up to him and grabbed his shoulder.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s a big problem, Kanji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What is&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s Ayanokouji&apos;s transfer. You don&apos;t get it, do you&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then do you understand, Ken?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji is&#x2014;no, I don&apos;t understand everything either&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s that supposed to mean?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even so, Ayanokouji&apos;s an important presence for the class!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As Sudou raised his voice in anger, Yousuke approached and spoke to calm him down.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then he quietly turned towards me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What I wanted to confirm today was solely why you left the class. If it were for the sake of the class, I thought you wouldn&apos;t want to cause any misunderstandings for any of us, including me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You can rest assured. It&apos;s purely, 100%, a transfer solely for my own benefit.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;It seems so.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps, I was only saying that on the surface, and it was different in actuality. However, at the moment at least, Hirata didn&apos;t seem to be able to consider it that way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was someone who was much more sensitive than others when it came to trouble within the class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When he learned of my transfer, he probably wasn&apos;t too disturbed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My presence had both advantages and disadvantages. If I were gone, my disappearance could simply result in class management becoming more stable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Looks like it, and you&apos;re okay with that, Hirata? Just letting Ayanokouji transfer?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Regardless of whether it&apos;s good or bad, it&apos;s Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s choice. Besides, the school procedures are already completed without any mishaps, so if we were to call him back to our class, we would need the same amount of Private Points. It&apos;s not an amount we can prepare immediately.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you regret leaving the class, Ayanokouji, then I&apos;ll contribute all the money I have on hand. Right, guys?!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou tried to rally all the boys present, including Ike, but Akito and Keisei didn&apos;t immediately nod.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Given my indifferent attitude and the fact that I had made it clear I left on my own accord, they probably didn&apos;t think it was possible to call me back, nor were they inclined to do so.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kiyotaka<sup id=\"fnref-1-0b221183-dfeb-501c-8bb5-6b01d1432cb6\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-0b221183-dfeb-501c-8bb5-6b01d1432cb6\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup>&#xa0;left the class on his own free will. We have to respect that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Turning away from the persistent Sudou, Hirata faced me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is there anything you need to tell the class?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see&#x2026; Sorry for taking your time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Obediently, Hirata accepted everything and left the scene.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although he probably wasn&apos;t calm on the inside, exerting pointless effort here wouldn&apos;t improve the situation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Instead, he needed to focus on navigating the situation without causing problems among his classmates.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Suzune was relying on you. What kind of face do you plan to make from tomorrow onward&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey Ken, now that we know Ayanokouji left on his own, let&apos;s go back too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou bit his lower lip in frustration and was pushed by Ike to leave.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;re still friends even if you left the class. If you ever encounter any problems, feel free to consult us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Akito also gave a response and returned to the dormitory with Keisei.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I watched my former classmates leave and decided to return to the dormitory a bit later.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"0b221183-dfeb-501c-8bb5-6b01d1432cb6\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-0b221183-dfeb-501c-8bb5-6b01d1432cb6\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-0b221183-dfeb-501c-8bb5-6b01d1432cb6\">[1]: </a>For some reason, Hirata addresses him as &quot;Kiyotaka&quot; here rather than &quot;Ayanokouji-kun&quot;&#x2014;that isn&apos;t a translation mistake. We don&apos;t know why. It could be another mistake on Kinu&apos;s part; that wouldn&apos;t be the only mistake he may have made in this volume.</p></li></ol>",
