Later, Ichinose also rejoined her friends and waved goodbye to the three of us. Watching her leave, Hashimoto took a deep breath.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Their reaction&#x2026; It must have been quite a shock.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see. Ayanokouji Kiyotaka deliberately transferred this very day, waiting until after the opening ceremony, to maximize the disturbance in Class A?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If the transfer had been completed the day before, I risked the school notifying them or the homeroom teacher leaking it to them. Therefore, doing it when there was essentially no delay was best. In terms of time, the difference was less than an hour. However, I was in the same classroom as them before the ceremony and attended it as well. Horikita and the others must&apos;ve unconsciously felt that it was the beginning of their usual journey with their classmates for the last year.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That faint hope, that expectation, was flawlessly utilized.&#xa0;I was just waiting for the right timing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Did you calculate that far? That&apos;s ruthless. Even though I&apos;m on the side that benefits, it was hard to look directly at their faces when they were almost crying. In that respect, you don&apos;t seem to have any sympathy or hesitation, Ayanokouji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There shouldn&apos;t be any. And there can&apos;t be any. I came to Class C to ensure that in this final year, I could bring it to a position where it could claim Class A. Using the transfer at the most effective moment is a perfectly natural strategy.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If I were someone who still harbored lingering attachments, there was no way Class C would&apos;ve accepted me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Someone like that couldn&apos;t be entrusted with class leadership.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s really reassuring to have you as an ally.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The current difference in Class Points was significant.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if we were to force expulsions, it wasn&apos;t a tactic that could be employed frequently or repeatedly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To increase our chances of winning, even wasting the slightest opportunity wouldn&apos;t be allowed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m still somewhat skeptical about the alliance, but I&apos;m convinced for now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I agree. However, the problems are piling up, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka. If it becomes known that you tried to form alliances or proceeded with matters on your own without being recognized as a leader by most of the class, the backlash from within Class C will only intensify.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m aware of that. Sooner or later, there will be students who voice their opinions against me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if they were unsatisfied, the class had no choice but to silently observe.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To pull me out of Class A, they all contributed their private points.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was what&apos;s commonly known as the sunk cost fallacy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">People couldn&apos;t accept that the cost they&apos;ve invested in would result in a loss so easily.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Therefore, while they&#x2019;d criticize me, they&#x2019;d also give me some leeway, hoping for a result that matches their efforts.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This seemingly reckless alliance strategy was set up from the start in a way that left no choice but to compromise by first observing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto, who invested the most Private Points in me, was a good example of this.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then, first and foremost, you have to gain the class&apos;s approval, fast.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If a special exam can do that, things would be quicker.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Morishita, who stood up from her chair, glanced briefly at Hashimoto after his response.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I wonder about that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Can you unconditionally entrust an unknown student to create a strategy for the special exam?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This time, if you weren&apos;t the one mainly involved in bringing Ayanokouji Kiyotaka to the class, you would be the prime candidate for opposing such a plan. If not, refute my claim perfectly with just one, singular word.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;One word is impossible&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hmph.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Seeing that Hashimoto didn&apos;t have a perfect rebuttal, Morishita left her seat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s tiring dealing with her.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Was Morishita like that before I started talking to her?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;She hasn&apos;t changed. But sure, she wasn&apos;t someone who actively involved herself with others. In that sense, you&apos;ve gotta be somewhat of an exception to her.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I felt a mix of emotions, unsure whether I should be genuinely pleased.</p>",
