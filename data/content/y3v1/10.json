was embedded&#x2014;my classroom.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I stopped and stared intently at the neatly polished plaque.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve finally made it here&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although the reality still feels somewhat distant, I know the situation before me isn&apos;t a dream.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From Class 1-D to Class 3-A.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There&apos;s been many fun and happy moments, but I must not forget the painful experiences.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The journey here was by no means smooth.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yamauchi-kun, Sakura-san, and Maezono-san.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What exists here now is built upon the sacrifices of those who had to leave our class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I must not forget that.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Come to think of it, when I entered the school, I didn&apos;t have any clear goals.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was here simply to follow after my older brother.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, my brother continued to keep his distance and coldly pushed&#xa0;me away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Despite this, as I continued my school life, I came to realize my brother&apos;s true feelings.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was made to learn that it wasn&apos;t sufficient to just chase after him, denying my own potential.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Now, I&apos;m a member of the student council, and I even read a congratulatory speech at the entrance ceremony.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&apos;m walking an unbelievable path.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I must not forget that, behind me on this path, Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s presence has been significant.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If he hadn&apos;t been in the same class, I certainly wouldn&apos;t be who I am now.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I would&apos;ve been more immature and clumsy, and I wouldn&apos;t have been able to close the distance with anyone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though his inscrutable demeanor sometimes troubles me, that is part of his charm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Anyway, since that day, I truly decided to set my sights on graduating from Class A.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Not just for my brother or for myself&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But to share the joy with everyone in the class, starting with Ayanokouji-kun.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This is what this place, Class A, is about.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A place I could never have reached alone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&#x2014;I must not be complacent.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Now, the path to the summit has only just been cleared.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There is still one more year of school life left.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ryuuen-kun&apos;s class is quickly catching up right behind us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even though they&apos;re a bit far away, I can&apos;t underestimate Ichinose-san&apos;s class or the former Sakayanagi-san&apos;s class either.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They&apos;ll try to overtake us by any means necessary in the future.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Conversely, we must fight to escape and prevent them from catching up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I took a deep breath&#xa0;and turned away from the nameplate.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For now, the celebration ends here.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I decided to tighten my resolve anew.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With that thought in mind, I opened the classroom door.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Inside the classroom. A large monitor, serving as a blackboard, displayed the pre-assigned seats.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;My seat is&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Second row from the corridor side, fourth from the front.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was my seat on the first day in Class 3-A.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And next to that seat, first row, fourth seat, was Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s name.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;To think I&apos;d be next to him again, huh&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although our seating arrangement had been quite different, we also sat next to each other two years ago.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Even if there were to be a seating change soon, I don&apos;t dislike such coincidences.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Feeling a sense of amusement at the overlap in this arrangement, I sat down in my seat. It was still early for school, so Ayanokouji-kun hadn&apos;t shown up yet.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wanted to share my thoughts on this seating with him as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I gazed out at the scenery.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The view looked slightly different from both my first and second years.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">One more year.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In just one more year, my time at this school will come to an end.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>At that time&#x2014;with this class, with these companions&#x2014;I want to graduate from Class A.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wouldn&apos;t let it end as just a dream.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter what, I have to make it happen.</p>",
