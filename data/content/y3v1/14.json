Everything begins from there.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I shouldn&apos;t make any conclusions at this stage yet.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I must not conclude anything.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I forced myself to suppress my emotions and continued walking, though, my&#xa0;steps felt heavy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I decided to call out to Ayanokouji-kun after closing enough distance between us, Hashimoto-kun, who had noticed us, quickly stood up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey, Horikita. We&apos;re in the middle of a strategy meeting right now, but do you need something?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was well aware that I would be treated as an unwanted guest here.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But right now, I only wanted to talk to Ayanokouji-kun.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I want you to let me have a conversation with Ayanokouji-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you want to talk to our leader candidate, you&apos;ll have to go through me first.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Leader candidate&#x2026; That&apos;s quite a sudden thing to say.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not sudden. I&apos;ve been waiting for this moment all along. Right, Ayanokouji?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto-kun laughed and sought Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s agreement.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wanted him to outright reject such an absurd notion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But I couldn&apos;t directly meet&#xa0;Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s eyes as he looked my way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wasn&apos;t confident in facing the words he would utter next&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I won&apos;t deny it. With Sakayanagi around, that chance was nonexistent anyway.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t want to hear such words.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ignoring it, I continued.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you mean by this? Doing such a thing, transferring classes, really?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;d be bad if you just start talking on your own.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but I need you to be quiet right now, Hashimoto-kun. As the class leader, I have to grasp the current situation.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see, as the class leader, huh? Well, it&apos;s certainly natural since a classmate suddenly left, but that makes it all the more reason why I can&apos;t let you check. It&apos;s convenient for us if you guys are troubled.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto-kun smiled slyly; his reasoning was sound.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, driving me away, who had barged in by myself, was undoubtedly better for Class C.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t glare at me like that. By the way, why&apos;s Matsushita here at this crucial moment?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto-kun asked, concerned about the strange combination.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Despite his constant vigilant nature, he still had a habit of poking into troublesome places.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It&apos;d be better if he wasn&apos;t concerned with who was present, but he pretended to care and stirred things up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>How should I answer to satisfy him?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I was about to think it over, Matsushita-san lined up beside me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m just accompanying her. I&apos;m only here to convey to my class what I&apos;ve seen and heard as a normal classmate rather than a leader. It seems Horikita-san is quite absorbed with Ayanokouji-kun, but honestly, it&apos;s not a big problem for us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if deliberately taking on the thankless role, Matsushita-san answered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I took her words graciously and gently nodded.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see. Indeed, it must look like a strange transfer to everyone but a few students. There&apos;s no reason for Ayanokouji to drop to a lower class, and above all, questions like, &apos;why would a student like Ayanokouji&#x2026;?&apos; is going around.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, there shouldn&apos;t be that many people like me and Sudou-kun yet&#x2014;people who knew even a fraction of Ayanokouji Kiyotaka&apos;s true abilities.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Matsushita-san here should be no exception&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ayanokouji-kun, having looked at us once, shifted his gaze back to Hashimoto-kun, who was about to sit down again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What Matsushita just mentioned about being an accompaniment must be a pretext.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;A pretext? But Horikita seemed convinced, didn&apos;t she?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s a misunderstanding. To Horikita, Matsushita might seem like just another classmate. But in reality, she&apos;s quite a schemer. It seems she values my abilities as much as Horikita does, or maybe even beyond that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s words, I looked at Matsushita-san.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She appeared calm, but I could see a slight disturbance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Her understanding of Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s abilities was deeper than I thought, and she even knew about it earlier than I had imagined&#x2026;?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was how I took Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s tone to mean&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Matsushita must&apos;ve thought that she couldn&apos;t leave this matter to Horikita.&#xa0;That&apos;s why she came to see me with her own eyes, to verify the reasons for the transfer, my true intentions. Just by looking at the OAA or observing her in everyday life, Matsushita might look like a mere honor student, but in actuality, she&apos;s one of the sharpest minds in Horikita&apos;s class. Usually, she doesn&apos;t put forth all her effort and works behind the scenes. In fact, in this situation, it&apos;s better to see that Matsushita can analyze the situation more calmly than Horikita.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh no, Ayanokouji-kun, you really seem to be overestimating me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Matsushita-san tried to deny it, but Ayanokouji-kun relentlessly showered her with his words.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s not the case. There have been several instances where you&apos;ve skillfully arranged things from behind the scenes when I needed help. Even when Maezono was expelled, it was because you lent a hand. I&apos;m actually giving you a fair evaluation.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ayanokouji-kun answered, and looking at Matsushita-san again, she no longer seemed capable of completely hiding her disturbance. This was the cooperative relationship between Ayanokouji-kun and Matsushita-san, which had likely been happening without my knowledge.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was casually exposed in front of the other classes&apos; students.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>To make it clear that he was no longer an ally&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No, for him, he might not even consider this as exposing us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ichinose-san, who had been listening to the conversation with keen interest, rested her chin on her hands and smiled.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I didn&apos;t know she was such a reliable person. I still have much to learn about the students here. From now on, I&apos;ll have to pay close attention to Matsushita-san.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It felt as if the ground was shaking beneath me, and I was about to lose my sense of balance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a thought I would never have had before&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The feeling that this situation had completely turned into the opponent&apos;s ground suddenly attacked both me and Matsushita-san.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There&apos;s no point in exploring the reasons for the transfer. I haven&apos;t told anyone about this, not Horikita, not Matsushita&#x2014;not anyone in the class. I&#x2019;m sure you can tell; neither Hashimoto, Morishita, nor Ichinose are surprised by my transfer. You understand what I mean by this difference?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s&#x2026; maybe just something you only mentioned to them after meeting up at the cafe&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then go back to Class C or catch someone from the class and ask. They should tell you when they knew about the transfer.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I lost the voice I should&apos;ve uttered with.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I couldn&apos;t immediately think of the words to say.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s scary when a student leaves the class, huh, Horikita? Our class also had Katsuragi leave, and some information flowed to Ryuuen, but even then, Katsuragi was an outsider&#x2026; No, Sakayanagi made him an outsider, so he hardly had any kind of insider knowledge. However, Ayanokouji isn&apos;t like that, right? He was at the core of your class, so it seems likely that digging into things will reveal a lot about Matsushita and others.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto-kun, seemingly amused, lightly knocked on the table.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So Horikita, it&apos;s about time you stated&#xa0;your business here. We&apos;re busy discussing things.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There&apos;s nothing specific&#x2026; I just&#x2026; Like I said, I just want to talk with Ayanokouji-kun.&#xa0;Preferably, just the three of us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;As you can see, I&apos;m currently having a discussion with Hashimoto and the others. Let&apos;s talk right here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;It&apos;s hard to talk about things here. If you&apos;re busy, it&apos;s fine to talk at night, or tomorrow, or the day after&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but I&apos;m booked for a while after this.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter how much I was rejected, I had to keep acting tough.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There were many students in the cafe, including my classmates.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If I carelessly lost my composure here, it would affect Class A&apos;s future direction.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then, let me talk here&#x2026; I came to hear your true intentions. I&apos;m sure you understand why, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You really want to know the reason for the class transfer?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. What were you thinking doing something like that&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Was I the reason?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Or was there something that changed your heart?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a&#xa0;voice that couldn&apos;t be heard.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I desperately tried to keep my heart&apos;s inner screams from becoming reality.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but I don&apos;t feel like answering. The only thing I can make clear is that the fact I moved from Class A to Class C is real&#x2014;it isn&apos;t a dream or an illusion.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He averted his gaze from me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He said he&apos;d listen, but it was almost like being turned away at the door.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Unfortunately, there&apos;s nothing more to say.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re okay with not answering anything? Ayanokouji-kun, you&apos;ll be treated as a traitor, you know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Matsushita-san persisted, speaking those words.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Isn&apos;t that more or less the case already?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He didn&apos;t care how others viewed him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He wasn&apos;t even thinking about whether he had the resolve to go through with it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;I see.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Persisting any further here wouldn&apos;t yield any results.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was clear that it would only expose my miserable self.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No&#x2026; I had known from the start that it would turn out this way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If he was worried about being seen, he simply would&apos;ve taken the steps to have this meeting in the dorms or later in the day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I understood this, but I just couldn&apos;t restrain myself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let&apos;s go, Matsushita-san. He&apos;s become my enemy, I understand that well. It&apos;s clear that there&apos;s no need to be discreet going forward.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I turned my back on him and started walking again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But I didn&apos;t think I felt any clear emotions from what remained here.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Only a feeling like that of a headache or a dizziness&#x2014;an indescribable nausea&#x2014;continued to cling to me.</p>",
