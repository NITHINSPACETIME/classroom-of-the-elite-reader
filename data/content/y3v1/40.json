Their reaction seemed to reflect not only the transfer issue but also the results of the recent exam. Their impression of me seemed to be gradually changing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without paying much attention to those two, I headed to the exit and left the school.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, I headed straight back to the dorm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">On the way there, I saw Utomiya and Tsubaki walking toward me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Hello.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Utomiya, not bothering to hide his reluctance, gave a light nod.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It feels like it&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve seen the two of you together.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;re not together all the time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Tsubaki answered indifferently.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since there was nothing in particular to talk about, I tried to pass by rather than stopping.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There&apos;s a rumor about you transferring classes.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Tsubaki seemed uninterested, but she mentioned the topic as a casual conversation starter.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Going from Class A to C right after just reaching Class A, that certainly isn&apos;t normal.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, it&apos;s because Senpai isn&apos;t normal, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe so.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The last time I spoke with Tsubaki was early in the morning during&#xa0;the training camp, where we had a brief chat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We talked about who they wanted to meet after graduation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Eventually, Horikita and Ibuki woke up, interrupting our conversation, and although it seemed like we could&apos;ve continued chatting, we hadn&apos;t had the chance to talk since then.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even now, as we met, it didn&apos;t seem like they wanted to bring up anything important.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We have somewhere to be, so excuse us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sure.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I also had an appointment and couldn&apos;t afford to chat for long.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We started walking and passed each other.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At that moment, Tsubaki directed an intense stare toward me from the corner of her eye.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After passing by the seemingly eager Tsubaki, I felt a sense of nostalgia.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Tsubaki Sakurako&#x2026; huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A forgotten memory.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Unnecessary memories.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Humans are such mysterious creatures.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if you thought you had forgotten something, it was surprising what you might&apos;ve been able to find.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What is it? It&apos;s creepy when you suddenly call me by my full name.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having caught her voice, Tsubaki stopped and turned around, looking somewhat displeased.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Calling it creepy was probably too much, but indeed, somebody calling you by your full name could be jarring.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At first, Morishita&#x2019;s way of addressing me made me feel really uncomfortable, though, now I tried not to mind it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I remembered the time when we talked during the training camp.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Huh? You remember what the conversation was about? That must&apos;ve been trivial for you, Senpai.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What did you talk to this person about?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah, it&apos;s nothing to do with you, Utomiya-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Utomiya sharply interjected and averted his gaze uncomfortably.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We were interrupted in the middle of our conversation back then.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, yes, but it wasn&apos;t a big deal for you, Senpai, so it doesn&apos;t really matter&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Recently, I suddenly thought of someone other than my family that I&apos;d like to meet. It&apos;s probably thanks to the story you told at the training camp, so I should at least thank you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Someone other than your family? Who is it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I thought Tsubaki would&apos;ve been troubled by such lengthy information, but for some reason, she asked me a question in response.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How should I put this? If I had to put it in familiar terms, they would probably be a childhood friend&#x2026; I guess.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yes. I had remembered them again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had forgotten most of their names already, but there were children my age who studied together with me in the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Among them was a girl.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her name was Yuki.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was her name. I couldn&apos;t be sure I was right, but I might&apos;ve been able to recall because the name Yuki reminded me of the camellia, Yuki-Tsubaki<sup id=\"fnref-1-090e94f4-50d6-504f-a4fb-89d86902bbcf\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-090e94f4-50d6-504f-a4fb-89d86902bbcf\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup>, and somehow the impression I got from Tsubaki seemed to remind me of Yuki.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That must&apos;ve been the accidental trigger that evoked this faint memory.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>No&#x2014;was it really just a coincidence?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&apos;Senpai, do you like snow<sup id=\"fnref-2-d323ff37-d9b1-5fa5-8c40-2e12ef9255b4\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-2-d323ff37-d9b1-5fa5-8c40-2e12ef9255b4\" data-ref=\"2\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[2]</a></sup>?&apos;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was a question Tsubaki asked during the training camp. At that time, it felt normal, but now it felt different.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;What will you do when you meet them?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Tsubaki shouldn&apos;t have been interested in this anymore, but she continued.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not actually going to meet them. It&apos;s just that I suddenly felt nostalgic, so I thought I&apos;d like to.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The past and present. If we had met again, things might have seemed different than before.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But it&apos;d be better not to meet.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I merely felt like things might&apos;ve been different, nothing more.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The reality probably hadn&apos;t changed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The new emotions that might&apos;ve risen&#x2026; would probably be nothing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whether there really was a connection between <em>that girl&#xa0;</em>and Tsubaki, it was still a meaningless, pointless matter.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"090e94f4-50d6-504f-a4fb-89d86902bbcf\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-090e94f4-50d6-504f-a4fb-89d86902bbcf\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-090e94f4-50d6-504f-a4fb-89d86902bbcf\">[1]: </a>&quot;Yuki-Tsubaki&quot; is the Japanese name for the snow camellia, otherwise known as Camellia japonica subsp. rusticana.</p></li><li data-id=\"d323ff37-d9b1-5fa5-8c40-2e12ef9255b4\" data-ref=\"2\" class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-2-d323ff37-d9b1-5fa5-8c40-2e12ef9255b4\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-2-d323ff37-d9b1-5fa5-8c40-2e12ef9255b4\">[2]: </a>&quot;Snow&quot; in Japanese is &quot;Yuki,&quot; with the same exact kanji character (&#x96ea;).</p></li></ol>",
