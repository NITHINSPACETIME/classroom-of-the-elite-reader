This is kind of a silly topic, but while I was cleaning up my house, I found my elementary school and junior high graduation yearbooks. I read through them again. In my elementary school book, I wrote that I wanted to become a game programmer, and I reflected deeply on the difficult industry I dreamed of entering. In my junior high book, I said that I wanted to write for a living, because I had no talent for drawing… (Well, that’s what I </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">wanted</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> to say, but I was too embarrassed to be specific.) Anyway, I digress, but I cried when I saw that a girl I was good friends with wrote “being able to meet Kinugasa-kun” in the section about the best things that happened in junior high. I guess there are some things that are best left unnoticed, huh?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Jokes aside, the second semester of the second-year story arc has officially started. This semester is packed with major events, and the cultural festival and school trip in particular will be new kinds of stories as they were things that didn’t happen in the first-year arc. I sincerely hope that you’re looking forward to what’s to come. Please sit tight!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Looking back on this fifth volume, almost none of the students from the other grade levels made an appearance this time. I was thinking it really </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">has</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> been a long time since there was a story like this, with just this group of characters. The stories of the first-years and third-years will continue to develop, but this volume served as a reminder that the focus of the story is on the students currently in their second year. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Moving on, I have a little announcement to make! To be honest, one of the things that I’ve been eagerly looking forward to for a long time but that I just couldn’t seem to make a reality was a manga of the second-year arc. However, I’m pleased to announce that we’ve finally reached the stage where I can tell you all about it. The manga version of </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Classroom of the Elite Year 2</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> by Xia&#160;Sasane-san will be serialized in Japan starting in the December 2021 issue of </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Monthly Comic Alive</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">. Thank you so very much! Also, I would once again like to express my deepest thanks to Yuyu Ichino-san, who is continuing to draw the first-year arc manga. I would like to extend my gratitude to you all for turning what I couldn’t do into a reality.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Lastly, there’s something else that I’ve been keeping in the back of my mind for the past two years now, and I’m hoping I’ll be able to touch upon it in the postscript for the next book, which will be volume six.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Well, the next time we meet, it will be the start of 2022! See you next year!</span></p>\r\n",
