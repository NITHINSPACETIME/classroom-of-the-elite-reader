Been keeping that tradition steady. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Hello everyone, it’s your Kinugasa here. It’s the first year of the Reiwa era, so how are you all doing? Me, I’m full of energy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">As for what I’ve been up to recently, I went kayaking out on the sea one weekend, and I did nothing but work the rest of the time. I’ve been quietly working, even now, while thinking to myself, </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Maaan, I’d love to go for a drive and take an overnight trip to an </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">onsen</span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\"> somewhere during the fall vacation. </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Come to think of it, I haven’t been able to really go out and visit any shrines properly for the past year or two now. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">This is a digression, but lately, I’ve really been feeling my age. I used to think I was great at handling machines and gadgets like computers, but now I’m noticing myself having trouble keeping up with the functionality of mobile devices as they are continually updated with new versions and revisions. They’re way too complicated. I&#160;can’t figure out what’s what at all. And I only use the bare minimum of an app’s functionality, basically leaving everything else completely untouched. When I look at myself objectively, I can see myself being labeled as one of those adults who aren’t good at handling machines. Even when driving my car, there are lots of buttons and functions I don’t understand…</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ah… Yeah. I guess I’ll never be able to keep up.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Anyway, that’s enough about me being pathetic… </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Okay, so, the first-year arc of the story has now ended. It’s strange, because it seems like it was so long, but also feels like it was over in an instant. There’s the main character, Ayanokouji, and his circle of friends. Although only a few of those many friends appeared in this book, I&#160;think you can see the various ways that they’ve changed and grown.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Starting with the next volume, the second-year arc of the story will finally begin. From there, the story won’t just focus on the conflict between classes, but also on battles with upper- and lower-grade levels, as well as against the school itself. There will be battles on all sides! The amount of information being revealed is going to go up, so there may be some difficult parts, but please, bear with&#160;me.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Work on the illustrations is coming together steadily, and the main visuals are already in progress. I think some illustrations will be put publicly on display soon, so I hope that you’re looking forward to it. I sincerely hope that you’re looking forward to what’s to come in the next volume, too. No, wait—rather, in the next volume and beyond!</span></p>\n",
