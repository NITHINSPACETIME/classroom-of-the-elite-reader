I am trembling with fear, because this is basically an omen signaling the coming of my most despised season. However, I’m fortunate in the sense that there’s a recent trend toward self-restraint, so I can stay home without people getting angry at me. Still, having said that, I’m sure that my kids would love to play outside, so I wish there was a way to let them play without bothering other people. I guess that’s where my DIY skills and stuff can come in…</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Well, anyway, I started this off by mentioning trivial stuff, but yeah, Volume 4.5 was a summer story. My summer vacations from back when I was a student were so awfully long ago now, but…while people often say that they wish they could go back to the past and redo their school days, I’ve never once thought that. It’s not like there was anything particularly bad about it, I did have fun at school. But I absolutely do NOT have the patience or the confidence to repeatedly go through the cycle of waking up in the morning, studying, working a part-time job, and then going home. This is decline.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">My eyesight is getting worse day by day, and even thinking about what it’ll be like after another ten years is terrifying… The future is scary too! Unlike last year, this is a story about a vacation on a cruise ship where there were no special exams. It’s also a story about changes in Ayanokouji and Kei’s relationship and changes in their classmates. Changes in the new first-year students, and in Nagumo and the other third-years. I think that the students have shown tremendous growth, compared to summer vacation last year. And in contrast to the students who are growing, the adults supervising them…</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Now then, this is a little bit of a spoiler, but were you able to guess who the White Room students are? Yes, I’m sure you’ve got a good idea. I know. The story begins from here, right? Staring in Volume 5, the year-two arc of the story will enter its second act, and I think it’s going to be a major turning point. The next volume will be the start of the second semester, and there will be a special exam separated by grade level. I was surprised when I realized that this was going to be the first time in a while (at least in several volumes) that there was a special exam that was only about the second-years. I would really be happy if you enjoyed the upcoming volume as well.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">There are various difficulties out there in the world right now, but let’s all do our best to get through it, everyone. Well, then, I hope can we meet again soon!</span></p>\r\n",
