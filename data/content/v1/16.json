Tomorrow, the midterm would be upon us. Class had ended for the day. After Chabashira-sensei ended the homeroom period and left the classroom, Kushida immediately leapt into action. She took out printed copies of the old test that I’d made at the convenience store and brought them up to the podium.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Everyone, before you return to the dorm, would you mind listening to me for a moment?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Everyone, including Sudou, stopped and listened to Kushida. This was a role that neither Horikita nor I could play. Only Kushida could do it. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I know that you’ve all been studying a lot in preparation for the test tomorrow. I have something to help you. I’m going to hand out some papers.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Kushida distributed the question and answer sheets to the students in the first row.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Test…questions? Did you make these, Kushida-san?” Horikita was visibly surprised by this sudden turn of events.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Actually, these are the old test problems. I got them from a third-year student last night.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Old test problems? Huh? Wait, will these questions be on the test tomorrow?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Yes. To tell you the truth, I heard that the midterm test from the year before last had almost exactly the same problems as this one. So, if we study what’s on this test, it’ll surely come in handy.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Whoa! Seriously? Thank you, Kushida-chan!” Overjoyed, Ike hugged his test paper. None of the other students could suppress their elation, either. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“What the hell? If we had </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">these</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">, then wasn’t it pointless to study so hard?” Yamauchi complained, even as he laughed.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It looked like I’d been right.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Sudou-kun, do your best when you study today!”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Yeah. Thanks, you really helped me out.” Sudou also happily accepted the test papers.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Let’s keep this a secret from the other classes! Don’t be scared, everyone! Do your best and aim for a high score!” Ike shouted with joy and determination. I was inclined to agree with him. We didn’t need to send supplies to the enemy. Everyone returned to the dorms with high spirits.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Kushida-san. Excellent work.” Horikita gave Kushida genuine praise, which was unusual.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Eh, really?” Kushida said.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I’d never even considered trying to use the old tests. I’m also grateful that you verified that the questions were still useful.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">True. The always-solitary Horikita hadn’t come up with that idea.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I just did it for my friends. It was nothing special,” Kushida said.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Also, I think that you were correct to announce that you had it today after class. If you’d carelessly let word get out about this test, it’s possible that everyone would have lost their motivation to study.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“That was only because I received the test papers so late. If many of the same problems are featured on the test tomorrow, then everyone will probably manage to get pretty high test scores.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Yes. It also means that the last two weeks we spent studying weren’t for nothing.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The past two weeks had probably been tremendously long for Sudou and the other failing students. Hopefully they’d gotten more into the habit of studying now.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“It was hard but fun.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I don’t think the Idiot Trio found it the least bit fun.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Well, we’d done as much as we could. The next step for those three simply came down to effort.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I just pray that I don’t draw a complete blank during the actual test.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Well, I couldn’t really do anything about that part. No matter how much they were taught and what they demonstrated during the study group, everything came down to their performance on the actual test. At least the previous questions were one crucial bit of help.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Well, should we head back?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita quietly looked over at Kushida as she put her textbook into her bag. “Kushida-san.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Hmm?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Really, thank you for everything you’ve done. If you weren’t here, the study group would not have succeeded.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Don’t worry about it. I just want to get into the higher-ranked classes together with everyone else. That’s why I did it, and why I agreed to help with the study group. I’ll help you again any time.” Smiling, Kushida grabbed her bag and stood.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Wait. There’s just one thing I want to confirm,” Horikita said.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Confirm?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“If you say that you’ll continue working with me for the sake of our class, then I need to be sure of something.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita looked straight at Kushida, who was still wearing that dazzling smile.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“You hate me, don’t you?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Hey, hey…” I’d wondered what she wanted to ask, but that was ridiculously unexpected.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Why do you think that?” Kushida asked.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“You’re not answering my question because it’s true. Right?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Ha ha, you got me.” She shouldered her bag and lowered her hands. Kushida faced Horikita without losing her smile. “That’s right. I really hate you.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">She answered clearly, making no attempt to hide it. She was direct.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Do you want me to tell you the reason?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“No. That’s unnecessary. Knowing that is good enough. I can continue working with you without hesitation.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Despite what she’d just been told, Horikita spoke calmly.</span></p>\r\n<div style=\"page-break-before: always;\"></div>\r\n<p class=\"P__STAR__STAR__STAR__page_break__And__Page_Break\"><span><span style=\" font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.17em;\">10.1</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\">&#160;</p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-weight: bold; font-size: 3.00em;\">“T</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">here are no absences today. It appears everyone is present.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Chabashira-sensei strode through the classroom with a bold smile on her face.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“That’s the first hurdle for you leftovers. Are there any questions?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“We’ve studied diligently these past few weeks. I don’t think that anyone will fail.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Oh my. You sound quite confident, Hirata.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Everyone wore a confident look. The teacher promptly took up the test papers and passed them out. Our first period test was for social studies. Out of everything we’d studied, it was probably the easiest subject.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“If anyone stumbles here, the other tests will be an uphill battle, quite frankly. You’ll take this midterm and the final exam in July. If no one fails either test, you’ll be rewarded with a vacation during your summer break.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“A vacation?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“That’s right. A dream vacation on an island surrounded by the brilliant blue sea.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Of course, the beach in summer meant we’d be able to see the girls in their swimsuits…</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Wh-what is this strange pressure…” one of the boys muttered.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Chabashira-sensei stepped back from the obvious tension the students exuded… mostly the boys.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Everyone. Let’s do our best!”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Yeah!” Ike howled along with our classmates. I shouted too, my voice getting lost in the cacophony.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Pervert.” Horikita glanced at me. I immediately fell silent. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Before long, everyone had their test papers. On the teacher’s signal, everyone began. I held off on starting for a moment and looked around at the others. With everything they’d learned, could the Idiot Trio avoid failing? First off, how many of this test’s questions were the same as the ones from the old exam? I needed to check that first.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">All right.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I discreetly clenched my fist in triumph. Despite my fears, the questions here were the same as the old ones. I hadn’t looked them over in any detail, but I saw no great difference. If I’d memorized what was on the old test, it was clear that I could get a near-perfect score. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Glancing around the classroom for assurance, I didn’t notice any students looking flustered or confused. I assumed that many of them had engaged in some last-minute studying. Slowly, I went through and answered all of the problems.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The second and third period exams were for Japanese and chemistry, respectively. While I worked, I discovered something else that intrigued me. Looking over the problems again, I realized that what Horikita had drilled into the study group was consistent with what was on the test. She’d been able to accurately predict what problems would appear just from the lessons. The silent girl beside me was even more impressive than I’d imagined.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Then came fourth period. Mathematics. All of the abnormally difficult questions that had been featured on the mock test also appeared here, but the content was the same as the old exams. Even if Sudou and the other guys couldn’t understand the problems, they could still apply the answers if they’d memorized them.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Then came the break.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Some members of our study group, including Ike, Yamauchi, Kushida, Horikita, and myself, gathered together.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“An easy victory! We’ve got this test on lock!”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I feel like I might get 120 points.” Ike sounded pretty sure of himself. Yamauchi must have felt the same, judging from the smile on his face. Confident, they looked over the old test papers for a final review.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Sudou-kun, how about you?” Kushida spoke to Sudou, who sat alone at his desk and stared fixedly at the old test material. However, Sudou looked sullen.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Sudou-kun?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Huh? Oh, sorry. I’m kind of busy.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">He didn’t look up from the questions as he spoke. He was reviewing the English test material, his forehead covered in a thin layer of sweat.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Sudou, did you…not study the old test material, by chance?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Everything but English. I fell asleep partway through.” Sudou sounded irritated. In other words, this was his first time reviewing the material.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Eh?!”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">That also meant that Sudou only had ten minutes to review.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Damn, I can’t get any of these answers to stick in my head,” he muttered.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Unlike the other tests, the English problems weren’t easy to memorize. Trying to cram all of the answers in just ten minutes would be impossible.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Sudou-kun, memorize the problems that are worth a lot of points and those with the shortest answers.” Horikita leapt up from her seat and moved next to Sudou.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“O-okay.” He stopped focusing on the low-point questions and instead zeroed in on what would net him the most points.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“A-are you going to be okay?” While trying to avoid getting in the way, Kushida appeared anxious.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Unlike Japanese, I don’t know the basics of English. These letters look like some kind of magic spell or something. Memorizing it’ll take time.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Y-yeah. I struggle with English, too…”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The break passed in the blink of an eye, and the heartless class bell rang.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I did all I could. I’ll try to answer the questions I remember first, before I forget them.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Yeah…”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">And thus began our English test. While the other students calmly made their way through, Sudou clearly had trouble. Occasionally, he’d stop writing and whack his pen against his head. However, no one could help him now. Whether Sudou sank or swam was entirely up to him.</span></p>\r\n<div style=\"page-break-before: always;\"></div>\r\n<p class=\"P__STAR__STAR__STAR__page_break__And__Page_Break\"><span><span style=\" font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.17em;\">10.2</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\">&#160;</p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-weight: bold; font-size: 3.00em;\">A</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">fter the last test,</span><span style=\" font-size: 0.80em;\"> </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">we gathered around Sudou’s desk again.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Hey, did you do okay?” asked Ike, anxiously.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Sudou was on the verge of losing his cool.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I don’t know… I did everything I could, but I have no idea how well I did…”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Don’t worry. You studied as hard as you could. I’m sure you did well.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Damn it, why did I fall asleep?” Sudou fidgeted, clearly frustrated with himself. Horikita then stepped in front of him.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Sudou-kun.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“What is it? Are you going to lecture me again?” he grumbled.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“It was certainly your fault for not reviewing the old test’s final section. However, as you said, you did everything that you could with the time that you had. You didn’t cut any corners or give up. Considering how much effort you put in, I think you should hold your head high and feel proud.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“What is this? Are you trying to comfort me?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Comfort? I’m speaking the truth. When I look at how far you’ve come, I understand how hard studying is for you, Sudou.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita was genuinely praising him. None of us could believe what we were seeing.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Let’s wait for the results.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Yeah… Okay.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“There’s…one more thing. Something I need to amend.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Amend?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Earlier, I said that your dreams of becoming a professional basketball player were foolish.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Why are you reminding me of that?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I researched how someone could become a professional basketball player, and I learned that the road to success is an incredibly rocky one.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“So, you’re telling me to give up because it’s a reckless dream?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Not at all. I know that you’re passionate about basketball. I also realize that you probably understand how difficult it is to play professionally.” Horikita still acted in her normal, aloof manner, but this was clearly an apology, albeit an awkward one. “There are many Japanese people who fight to enter that profession. There are some among those who wish to become internationally renowned. You’re one of those people, right?”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Yeah. I’m incredibly stupid, but I want to play ball. Even if I have to live a pathetic, miserable life as a part-time worker or worse, I’m going to achieve my dream.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I never thought I needed to understand anyone except for myself. So when you first told me that you wanted to play basketball, I insulted you. However, I now regret that. Someone who doesn’t understand how difficult, how arduous basketball is has no right to dismiss that dream as foolish. Sudou-kun, don’t forget the hard work and effort that you poured into studying. Apply that diligence to basketball. If you do, you might be able to go pro. At least, that’s how I feel.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita’s expression was the same as always, but she bowed her head to Sudou.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I’m sorry for what I said back then. Well. Now that I’ve said my piece, I’ll be going.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita left the room, her apology still hanging in the air.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Hey, did you just see that? Horikita apologized! And so nicely!”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I can’t believe it!”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ike and Yamauchi were both completely stunned. I was pretty surprised, too. Kushida was as well. Horikita had acknowledged that Sudou had done his best. A dumbfounded Sudou, still seated at his desk, looked after Horikita as she walked through the classroom door. Soon after, Sudou, put his right hand over his heart and looked at us.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“O-oh, no… I… I think I might be in love with Horikita…” he said.</span></p>\r\n",
