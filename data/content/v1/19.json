This is Kinugasa Syougo. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I wrote this story about a year ago. </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Classroom of the Elite</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> came out of my transition from student to adult, and because I wanted to tackle a challenging subject. When I think back to my student days, I recall everyone continuously telling me that I had to study if I wanted to get into a good university, if I wanted to get a job in a good field, if I wanted to have a good life. Recently, I’ve had my doubts as to whether that advice was actually correct. Unfortunately, I’ve gone astray, and leapt into a world far different from the one that my family and peers imagined for me…</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Of course, studying is important, and there’s no doubt that it is useful for a person’s future. But I believe that academics aren’t everything. For an easy example, sports are often part of an academic curriculum. Many people participate in sports. Everyone’s personality is unique, though. A child who has a talent for drawing might become an illustrator, or someone with the comedic gift might become an entertainer. Besides academics and sports, there are a near-infinite variety of callings and professions that suit all different types of people.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">When I started thinking about this, I began to consider those regrets that adults face for the first time. I thought, “If only I’d done this,” and started to regret my past. Lately, these ideas have been constantly on my mind.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Now, I’d like to list some acknowledgements.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Tomose Shunsaku-sama. Thank you so much for working with me time and time again. The male characters you draw are so wonder—no, I should say I give you my sincerest thanks because you draw both male and female characters that simply overflow with charm. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I will always make sure to show you how appreciative and thankful I am for your help. I sincerely look forward to working with you in the future. We should really go out to get some yakiniku soon. My treat. One of those cheap all-you-can-eat places!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">My editor, I-sama. Thank you so much for going over my writing. Though I’ve placed many burdens upon you with my previous work, I am sincerely grateful for all the effort you’ve put in, especially when this took a rather long time to complete. Huh? You say to knock it off and cut you a break? Ha ha ha, what a great joke. We have a long, long way to go. A one-way ticket all the way to the depths of hell. At least we’re falling together, right?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Normal\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Finally, there is you, the reader. Because you’re holding this book, you could say that in some sense you play a part in its central theme. While I am incredibly grateful to you more than anyone, I think we can conclude this volume here. It’s already the spring of 2015, but, as usual, my physical health is hardly perfect. I continue my longstanding battle with insomnia, but I’ll keep doing my best not to lose.</span></p>\r\n",
