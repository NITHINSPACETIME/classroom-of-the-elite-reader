Happy New Year! This is the postscript that I wrote in the middle of the night for no reason at all, and here’s Kinugasa, all super fired up!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Yep. Every year that goes by, I find it harder and harder to stay awake until the middle of the night. Back in my teens, I’d boast about trivial things like, “Hey, I can stay up for two whole days (48 hours) in a row!” But now that feels like a lie. Now, it’s like, I’ve only been awake this long (20 hours), and it feels like I’m gonna die. When did this happen?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Make sure you get at least six hours of sleep a day, at minimum.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Yes. Well, okay, so yeah, in this volume, we’re finally getting to the end of the first year…</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The end…is NOT here! Even though I said something in the previous postscript about how it seemed like it was going to end in the next volume, it’s actually not ending! In truth, I had originally planned to incorporate both the “supplementary special exam” and the “Year 1 final exam” in volume 10, but I ended up spending over half the book on the former. There was no way I could cram both parts into the same book, so this is how it turned out.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">While this book did turn out to be thicker than I had expected, the next volume will most definitely mark the end of the first year. After that, I’m planning for there to be another book in the interval between the end of the first year and the start of the second year (following the established [?] convention of 0.5 numbering).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Still, my plans seem to go awry after I write these postscripts, so I’m a little anxious.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">…I’m going to try not to think about that.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Anyway, unlike in my books, the year in real life goes by so fast! I really can’t believe that it’s already 2019 now (at the time of this book’s release), when I was just thinking that 2018 had only just started. Despite the fact that I’ve been wanting to move from releasing a book once every four months to once every three months, I haven’t been able to actually make that happen over these past few years. But I’m always aiming to get things done in a three-month span, you know?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">My illustrator, Tomoseshunsaku-san, and my editor have been an immense help to me in 2018, just like always. I’ll be counting on you again in 2019, so please continue to take care of me!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Anyhow, I sincerely hope that you, the reader, will continue to enjoy my works in 2019 as well.</span></p>\r\n",
