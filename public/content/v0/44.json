Those qualities&#x2014;the ability to choose wisely and the sense of values&#x2014;were things I learned from Naoe.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although he now became a detestable enemy, he had undeniably top-notch abilities.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The party had just begun. First, I made my rounds across the room, greeting everyone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s been a while, Ayanokouji-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Among various greetings, a middle-aged man with an unusually flamboyant hair color cheerfully approached me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He immediately switched to his business demeanor and turned around, extending his right hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s been a while, Company&#xa0;President Amasawa. It&apos;s been two years, right? I sent you an invitation, but I was nervous you might not come.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah, I couldn&apos;t make it last year, sorry about that. My girlfriend absolutely wanted to spend her birthday in Hawaii, and I was too busy with work to find the time. I ended up buying a house there and stayed in Hawaii the whole time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s good to hear that both your work and personal life are going well.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was slightly older than me, but in a negative sense, he didn&apos;t let it show.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He dressed in brands the youth favored and wore sandals that didn&apos;t fit the occasion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If nobody had known him, he definitely would&apos;ve been turned away from his casual attire.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He wasn&apos;t normal. It seemed like he was declaring his unique and original character.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t like this man&apos;s style or his way of thinking, but he was one of the people who played a significant role in financing the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although he hadn&apos;t attended the party last year, he had provided funding.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was a welcomed guest and deserved to be treated with care.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sensei, it seems you&apos;re no longer a sensei<sup id=\"fnref-1-fa174df6-2133-578d-861f-f7f9f9a65a78\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-fa174df6-2133-578d-861f-f7f9f9a65a78\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup>, but you don&apos;t let it show, huh? You look just like a shady politician.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He patted my shoulder with his palm, laughing merrily.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And you treat me the same, just like how you did when I was still a politician.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course. Ayanokouji-sensei, I hold you in high regard, you know.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While having this trivial conversation, I reflected on Amasawa&apos;s words from the beginning.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This man was married, but it was clear that the girlfriend he spent time with in Hawaii wasn&apos;t his spouse.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;May I have a moment?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Amasawa, still grinning, guided me toward the window.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I actually have a favor to ask of you, Ayanokouji-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A favor from you, President? What is it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, that girlfriend in Hawaii is pregnant. And she insists on giving birth in Japan.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s wonderful news, but it&apos;s a bit of a tricky situation, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Right? My wife suspects me of cheating, and if she finds out I secretly had a child, it would be a mess.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If he wanted to play around, he shouldn&apos;t have married in the first place, but that was another issue.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;She&apos;s afraid of losing her connection with me, that&apos;s why she&apos;s insisting on giving birth in Japan, even though she&apos;s a Hawaii enthusiast.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He shrugged his shoulders as if troubled, but he didn&apos;t seem very anxious.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m thinking of having the child educated in the White Room&#x2026; What do you think?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Would you be satisfied with that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Absolutely. What she wants is for our child to be born&#x2014;that&apos;s her goal. She has no intention of becoming a mother and raising the child.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For us, an increase in children who posed no danger was welcomed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, there were various things I had to confirm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;re already taking care of your daughter in the White Room, President Amasawa.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Would it be a problem if one more joined?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course, if necessary, I don&apos;t mind. Though, are you sure?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why not? She gets to have a child, I can offload an inconvenient child to the White Room, and you get to profit from it. Everyone&apos;s happy, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To this man, the White Room was merely a convenient daycare or something.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For us, it was a favorable and welcome arrangement.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re aware of this party&apos;s details, aren&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I understand. Of course, I&apos;ll provide thorough financing. Isn&apos;t that right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He raised one finger as he spoke.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This year, I&apos;ll double last year&apos;s amount. I&apos;ll give one hundred million<sup id=\"fnref-2-d096d99d-c7aa-5126-8208-ff26f3d6f96c\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-2-d096d99d-c7aa-5126-8208-ff26f3d6f96c\" data-ref=\"2\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[2]</a></sup>. If that can buy my safety, it&apos;s cheap.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Thank you very much. Do you know the expected delivery date?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah, wait a moment. I&apos;m receiving it in text.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He used his phone to ask for the hospital and the expected delivery date and instructed his subordinate to proceed with the arrangements.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well then, we&apos;ll handle everything smoothly on our end.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Thanks a lot.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He nodded in satisfaction and received two glasses of champagne from a boy walking nearby.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;To the happiness of my soon-to-be-born child, cheers.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He tilted his glass, made a &apos;clink&apos; sound, and drank down the champagne in one gulp.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;By the way, President Amasawa, you are aware of the White Room&apos;s rules, aren&apos;t you? Unless there&apos;s a special reason, visits are basically impossible. You can only meet your children regularly after they become adults or leave the White Room.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, yeah. I&apos;ve heard that before.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you really okay with that? This applies even to the mother.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course. Sending her regular photos should satisfy her.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Getting financing was all that mattered, though, there were formalities to maintain.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was another thing I had to confirm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;President, it&apos;s been quite some time since we took in your first daughter, but you haven&apos;t given us a visit to check on her even once. Have you thought about what you&apos;ll do in the future?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was relatively rare for a parent who had entrusted us with their child to never visit for such purposes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Most would come to check on the results.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;As for the future, please do as you like, Ayanokouji-sensei. After all, that was a test-tube baby, and I don&apos;t really feel like she&apos;s my own child.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Amasawa spoke without interest, as if this was just an extension of his pastime.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The White Room was entrusted with various children.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Some, like Amasawa&apos;s child, were test-tube babies, and some were children separated from their siblings in order to raise them differently from the others, testing to see how effective the White Room&apos;s education really was.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">You always had to maintain control of your tone and make sure you didn&apos;t offend the other party, understanding their feelings and circumstances.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well then, we&apos;ll handle everything on our side as we like.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Currently, she&apos;s the second most developed among the fifth generation. Her performance makes it seem like there isn&apos;t a gender disparity in abilities, and as long as she doesn&apos;t drop out, she&apos;ll certainly be useful.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course. Do whatever you like with her.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He casually placed his hand on my shoulder again and began humming happily.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Among the billionaires who had built fortunes worth tens and hundreds of billions, there were those who considered their children&apos;s lives worthless.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though few, this Amasawa was one of them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He didn&apos;t see his child as a status symbol; he was all about himself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>There might be opportunities to take more of Amasawa&apos;s children in the future.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then, I&apos;m going back now. It&apos;s been a while, so I want to enjoy Japan.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ll see you out.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I left the cheerful Amasawa to my subordinate and saw him off.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wanted to take a breather, but there was no time to rest.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"fa174df6-2133-578d-861f-f7f9f9a65a78\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-fa174df6-2133-578d-861f-f7f9f9a65a78\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-fa174df6-2133-578d-861f-f7f9f9a65a78\">[1]: </a>&quot;Sensei&quot; is an honorific that is attached to multiple occupations, including those of politicians.
