Instead, I was dozing off in the back seat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The deep softness of genuine leather seats, the warm touch enveloping my back&#x2014;all of these were far more luxurious than the car I used to drive.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wondered why it fell so far short of the excitement and joy I felt back then.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji-sensei, we will be arriving soon.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A voice from the driver&apos;s seat called out. I quietly opened my eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The urban scenery had changed into rough roads surrounded by mountains.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It will be a bit bumpy from here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I understand.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Three years had passed since Naoe-sensei entrusted me with the Human Resource Development Project.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At first, I wondered how it would turn out, but the project, officially named the White Room Project, had successfully begun in secrecy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The number of financiers wanting to invest increased day by day, and I successfully generated a surplus of funds. Of course, all the money collected was officially for the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The existence of the White Room had become a status symbol known only to those in the know.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a big investment opportunity.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though it had yet to show results, there hadn&apos;t been many instances in the past that have garnered this much anticipation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was just like specific stock shares: by the time the general public realized they were profitable, it was already too late.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Only those who invested large sums while the opportunity was still buried underground were allowed to win.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even without mentioning Naoe-sensei&apos;s name, my involvement allowed others to guess and understand things on their own.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That type of flow was working entirely in my favor.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">ANHS&apos;s existence, which the government had already successfully launched, wasn&apos;t insignificant.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even without mentioning it, the government would eventually get involved with the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Those who invested early could expect massive publicity and returns.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even though things had been going smoothly, if it turned out to be a disappointment by the time the lid opened, the investors wouldn&apos;t hesitate to turn their backs on me, and those who were calling out &quot;Sensei, Sensei&quot; would all start hurling insults.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Therefore, it was crucial to achieve clear and definite results. There couldn&apos;t be any complacency.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While I was moving, I received another call on my phone from a financier wanting to invest. Although I hadn&apos;t revealed the true worth of the first generation of children yet, once the acceptance period for the second generation started, hopeful candidates began to appear one after another.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I hadn&apos;t even told them how the first generation&apos;s education&#xa0;and growth were going.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, this was all part of my strategy. I was secretly spreading information that the White Room&apos;s education was going well, achieving more than expected, and that there might&apos;ve been insufficient space for all the applicants, thus enhancing its value. Additionally, there were those who wanted to use the White Room for purposes other than its intended goal. This was an issue inseparable from the wealthy&#x2014;the existence of illegitimate children.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Mistresses insisted on having children and, as a condition, had them placed in the White Room. This allowed them to completely erase the existence of the child in public.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The mistress could maintain a connection with the partner by having a child. Of course, for most ordinary people, this would be a difficult and incomprehensible situation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Securing more human resources for the White Room and securing funds were linked, so there was no reason for us to refuse. I accepted with a nod and immediately added them to the acceptance list.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;These people never learn.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Is it because they have money that people become strange?</em>&#xa0;<em>They easily repeat unwanted pregnancies through selfish acts</em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t mind using it to secretly give birth, but I was utterly amazed by their looseness down there.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With this, the acceptance of children who couldn&apos;t be publicly disclosed, such as illegitimate children, exceeded 30% of the entire second batch.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In other words, the White Room was still only <em>that</em>&#xa0;valuable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To entrust their beloved children to this project, we needed more trust and a proven track record.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The financiers were handing over money and children, but many still didn&apos;t know the real plan, and of course, most of the staff were unaware of the true intentions of the experiment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They probably didn&apos;t doubt that we simply planned to educate children born under an unlucky star and return them to society as respectable individuals.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It can&apos;t be helped.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As for me, my view of the children as subjects for experimentation was still overwhelmingly stronger.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Taking care of wealthy families&apos; precious children entailed a significant risk.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Bridging this discrepancy was an unavoidable challenge moving forward.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Regardless of the child, we had to give them a thorough education.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The White Room would eventually transform from a mere fantasy into a government-approved facility.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Educational institutions around the world would model themselves after the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Naoe-sensei and I would lead this initiative, increasing our influence within the party.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When the elderly Naoe-sensei would retire, a big position awaited me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Little by little, I was steadily making progress, one step at a time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That feeling was beginning to take root.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t wrong to have fully dedicated myself to the project from the day Naoe-sensei entrusted me with the Human Resource Development Project. There was undoubtedly a bright hope in the distant future.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, things weren&apos;t entirely free from anxiety.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While executing the White Room project, I inevitably distanced myself from the political world. They had a keen sense of smell. Some of them must&apos;ve already sensed that such a project was underway behind the scenes. As Naoe-sensei&apos;s right-hand man, I had many allies, but I also had many enemies trying to exploit my weaknesses.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To see whether they were our allies or enemies, I had to maintain my distance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The White Room had become a part of me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Nevertheless, I never neglected to strengthen my connections with the financial world.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Preparing for any eventuality was a universal principle.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If I couldn&apos;t expand my political connections, I would elevate my status in the financial world.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since the political and financial worlds were two sides of the same coin, this was a meaningful decision.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My ties with the financial world grew stronger by the day, and I chose to wear both the masks of a politician and a financier.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I shuffled money from right to left and from left to right, fortifying myself with the accumulated wealth.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Just now, Sakayanagi-san has arrived at the White Room.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see. Don&apos;t worry about the car&apos;s shaking, just hurry up a bit.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Understood.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even though there was still time until our appointment, it wasn&apos;t wise to make a guest needlessly wait.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"b702813e-7648-5d2c-9e4b-04e4dafc1c0f\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-b702813e-7648-5d2c-9e4b-04e4dafc1c0f\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-b702813e-7648-5d2c-9e4b-04e4dafc1c0f\">[1]: </a>A Kei car is a Japanese classification for cars that are considered &quot;light automobiles.&quot; For example, the Honda Beat, Suzuki Cappuccino, and Daihatsu Copen.</p></li></ol>",
