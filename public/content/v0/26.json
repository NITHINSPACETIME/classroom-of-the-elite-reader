Of course, there&apos;s no need to hold back.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s right. I&apos;ve been thinking all day while watching the children&apos;s growth.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>The significance of the White Room, the utility of the White Room&#x2014;could Sakayanagi feel it firsthand?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The children I saw today were far removed from the average three-year-olds I know. The children Suzukake-san educated, and even those by Ishida-san and Souya-san, are probably superior to 90% of the children in this world.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sakayanagi&apos;s characteristic, to start with praise, hadn&apos;t changed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even with wealthy families&apos; elite education, it wouldn&apos;t be easy to reach this level.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But from your tone, they can&apos;t compete with the remaining 10%?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Isn&apos;t that something you felt firsthand, Ayanokouji-sensei?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The children, now three years old, had almost certainly developed intelligence and physical abilities beyond average children.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Certain results <em>had</em>&#xa0;been achieved.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, the world would still harbor doubts, and I didn&apos;t think it was enough to dispel them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If asked whether these three-year-olds were equal or superior to the so-called gifted, it would be a gray area.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Waiting for the first group of children to turn four or five wouldn&apos;t be decisive.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;However, I think this is sufficient. If we can provide such thorough education to children who might not receive the education they need, they can acquire enough skills to function in society.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was Sakayanagi&apos;s overall assessment, unaware of the true nature of the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s why placing Suzukake-san as the leader gave me a hint of unease. Emotions are essential for children&#x2026; no, for humans. Nobody can exist without joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure. If you can correct that notion, I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to continue to support and assist you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see. I thought you would say that. However, do you think the current investors as well as the businessmen we&apos;ve yet to meet will be satisfied? Not everyone thinks only of the children like you do. There are significant interests involved in this White Room.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is a more rigorous education necessary?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. Anyone can produce geniuses if they have a certain amount of money. Just hire lecturers from top universities and coaches who have produced Olympic athletes. If you give children an elite education from a young age and maintain it, most of them will be able to enhance their skills to a certain extent. A White Room that only produces similar results bears no significance. It has no value.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Who would invest millions, or even billions in the White Room?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s needed are exceptional abilities&#x2014;a brain that can surpass Japan&apos;s top universities and win at the world&apos;s prestigious schools, physical abilities beyond Olympic athletes, and an indomitable spirit that doesn&apos;t flinch even against world leaders. That&apos;s the power the White Room needs.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Isn&apos;t that excessive charity? Not all children who are abandoned or without parents seek such power. It&apos;s enough to give them the ability to adapt and live in society.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I understand what you&apos;re trying to say. Your opinion will sufficiently act as a reference.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Ayanokouji-sensei, what you told me, it&apos;s true, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course. I am working to rescue disadvantaged children. You know I have my ambitions, but it&apos;s neither more nor less than that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sakayanagi, who had looked doubtful, slightly bowed his head in apology.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then, I have nothing more to say. Please provide an education full of love, considering the children first. Then, the day will come when the citizens recognize the White Room.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With that, Sakayanagi left the office. His face showed he wasn&apos;t convinced.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How naive, Sakayanagi. That won&apos;t do.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The world wouldn&apos;t accept such idealism alone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What was demanded wasn&apos;t just any result, but the best result.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, it still wasn&apos;t enough.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">One more push. Just one more push was needed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no guarantee that the investors would keep nodding their heads with the current results. <em>Something to shove their backs forward&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A decisive factor was needed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, imposing stricter education on the children now wouldn&apos;t yield immediate results.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Three years&#x2026; no, five years&#x2026; We needed to wait at least that long.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I needed to create persuasive power.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>What should I do&#x2026;?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>How can I get the financial world to put in more money in such a short period of time?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Think, keep thinking&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This White Room might change the world.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wanted my words to carry weight.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Weight&#x2026; huh?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;I see.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I remembered what Naoe-sensei had said here.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without sacrificing yourself, there was no true success.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter how passionately I discussed our education&apos;s success or failure, my words wouldn&apos;t truly carry weight. The financial world also didn&apos;t trust the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And why was that?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was obvious&#x2014;it was always someone else&apos;s education.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wouldn&apos;t hurt <em>me</em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was merely an extension of play.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I needed to show a solid reason why they could entrust their precious children to the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was only one thing I needed to do.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I picked up my phone and made a call to a certain person.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Hello?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was evening now, and the person on the phone, who was probably asleep, answered with a groggy voice.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Mika. I have a favor to ask of you.&quot;</p>",
