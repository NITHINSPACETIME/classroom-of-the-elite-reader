Don&apos;t make me laugh&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Once you dropped out of the world of politics, everything ended.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if you tried making a comeback, you&apos;d just be crushed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What will become of us now&#x2026; Is everything over? Is it&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Maybe I should&apos;ve just punched him&#x2026;?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No, punching Naoe there and indulging in momentary pleasure would&apos;ve been meaningless.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I would&apos;ve been arrested immediately, losing not only my status as a politician but everything else as well.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In the world of children&apos;s quarrels, it might&apos;ve been enough to exhibit strength through fighting.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, in this world, physical strength was just one of many weapons, and its effectiveness was weak.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Naoe, who looked like nothing more than an old man, had countless weapons.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t think you can use me and get away with it, Naoe&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I slammed my fist onto the tatami with all my might, venting my frustration.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In essence, I was just conveniently used and then discarded.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In the political world, once you fell, it was hopeless to get back up. The nail that stuck out would get hammered down, and that was the end.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is it over for me?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if I put it into words, no real feeling would emerge.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>How much bitterness do you think I&apos;ve had to swallow to change this country and stand at its pinnacle? Do you think I haven&apos;t tasted humiliation, insult, and contempt?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That man was no longer of any use.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, even if I were to strike out with something new now, I would just be crushed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Naoe and I were two sides of the same coin. With him on the front, if I were to crush him, the other side, me, would automatically get crushed too. It was fair to say that until he retired&#x2014;no&#x2014;died, my path to a comeback was completely blocked.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>So&#x2026; if he dies, I might get another chance to make a move.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Should I contact Ooba and have him take care of Naoe&#x2026;?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Am I an idiot&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If I made such a request, Ooba would just cut me off.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was clear which side would benefit him more.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kamogawa. Change your mindset. You have to start everything from scratch tomorrow.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s&#x2026; the only option, but&#x2026; What will you do, Ayanokouji-sensei? You wouldn&apos;t ignore an order from Naoe-sensei, would you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;It&apos;s over for me either way. Stopping with my resistance now won&apos;t change how I&apos;m treated. If so, I&apos;ll continue running the White Room even if I have to quit being a politician.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Wait, please! I respect you, Ayanokouji-sensei! I believe that someday, you will surpass Naoe-sensei! Please don&apos;t talk about quitting!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This is the predetermined path. It&apos;s not something I can overturn with my will. However, you still have a chance. Your father&apos;s influence remains. With that being the case, continue fighting under Naoe as a politician.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji-sensei&#x2026;!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not giving up on the White Room or politics, but I will abandon the latter for now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was the only way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No matter how much power Naoe has, he can&apos;t win against his lifespan. Eventually, he will die before us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If it was going to take time, then so be it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I&apos;ll let him enjoy his political life to the fullest while he&apos;s still around.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>But when that ends, I&#x2014;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I laughed and patted Kamogawa on the shoulder.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not just Kijima. When I return to politics, I&apos;ll turn his son to ashes too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Haha&#x2026; When you say it, Ayanokouji-sensei, it doesn&apos;t sound like a joke.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Wiping away his tears, Kamogawa spoke with a relaxed smile.</p>",
