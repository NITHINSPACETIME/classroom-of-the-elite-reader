She was just saying that you might be coming soon, and she was right. Please, this way.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was led to the usual VIP room at the back of the club.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Inside the room, several bottles were kept, and a few side dishes were prepared.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Preparations had been made before my arrival.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Please wait a moment.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The waiter bowed his head and left the room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I sat down on the luxurious sofa in silence, and a wave of fatigue washed over me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t even have the energy to reach for a drink and just leaned back in the chair.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Phew&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I let out a surprisingly deep sigh.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I hadn&apos;t been sleeping well lately.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The pressure of the Human Resources Development Project that was suddenly assigned and the grave responsibilities lurking behind it got to me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a life-or-death job that I couldn&apos;t afford to fail.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had figured out the location for the educational facility, but neither the funds to secure it nor the right educators had been found. Besides, I needed many hands to manage it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I needed to gather trustworthy personnel and devise a system to prevent leaks to the outside.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Naturally, that would cost even more money.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Money, money, money&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though Sakayanagi provided opportunities to obtain funds, I still didn&apos;t know what would actually happen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I wonder what will happen&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Unable to resist the onslaught of sleepiness, I closed my eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As I laid down, savoring the difference from the office&apos;s stiff fabric, I questioned how much time had passed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>A minute or an hour?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I suddenly woke up, there was a face peering at me from the side.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They were a familiar set of large eyes and lips.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was the usual gaze that looked at me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you awake?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;How long did I sleep for?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I sat up on the sofa and poured a glass of whiskey to wake up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Probably about ten minutes? You seem really tired.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was just ten minutes, but it seemed to have lightened my body a bit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Would you prefer tea or water instead, so that you won&apos;t overdo it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, at times like this, it&apos;s actually better to drink.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Mika sighed but nodded, skillfully topping up the alcohol and wiping the condensation off the glass.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I have a favor to ask you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is that the first thing you talk about after waking up? Can&apos;t you forget about work for a bit?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s not possible.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My hand naturally tightened around the glass I was holding.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s an important job, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There&apos;s no line between what&apos;s important and what&apos;s unimportant in work. Nothing can be lacking.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For me, even picking chestnuts out of the fire was a crucial mission.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Being a politician must be tough. From what I see on TV, the Diet&apos;s either sleeping, involved in corruption, or being pursued for womanizing. It seems like hardly anyone is doing their job properly.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was probably how the world of politics appeared to the general public.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">People thought that it was their job to hurl childish insults between the ruling and opposition parties.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s convenient for me. If the top guys were competent, I wouldn&apos;t have any opportunities to get in.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Thanks to many old, harmful politicians, I was able to aim for the few vacancies.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I think you&apos;re capable of becoming a great politician, Atsuomi.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Saying so, she gently placed her hand on my thigh.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For a woman who knows nothing about the world of politics, you sure talk big.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I may not know about politics, but I think I have a good eye for men.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The Mika sitting beside me had moved to Tokyo right after graduating from middle school, changed jobs repeatedly, and then threw herself into the world of hostess clubs. With her blessed looks and fearless attitude, she quickly climbed to the number two spot in this club.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I met her while scouting clubs for entertaining politicians, and our relationship deepened.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We had dated as lovers for a while, but that was in the past.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t cut ties with her then not just because of the physical aspect, but because she had a capable business side to her as well.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Mika, well aware of how to use her assets, had close relationships with several men who were key figures in both the ruling and opposition parties. She was a young and beautiful woman who could maintain relationships with them as an adult without affecting their families. Politicians carried many secrets. The more secrets people held and the heavier those secrets were, the more they wanted to talk about them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Politicians were wary of smart women. On the other hand, they were less cautious around women who seemed less intelligent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If there was a woman who responded with a casual &quot;really?&quot; as if she understood but didn&apos;t really, the pillow talk would proceed smoothly. Even if the politician ended up speaking carelessly, there was no need to worry if the other party didn&apos;t remember.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But Mika was different. She lacked knowledge but had at least some basic wisdom.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She sniffed out that every politician&apos;s words could turn into gold and knew all the ways to record them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And then, in exchange for her cooperation, she demanded the number-one spot and money from me, which was where everything started.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Moreover, she didn&apos;t just want to drag down the number one girl; she wanted her thoroughly crushed. I responded to her straightforward request and got rid of the former number-one spot by getting her addicted to drugs.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Now, she was probably somewhere entertaining sleazy clients for cheap change.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After that, our relationship deepened, and we maintained a mutual give-and-take connection.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I want to get a hold on a few people.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">On the table, I laid out photos of seven business figures I had managed to pick up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do you recognize any faces here, or see someone you might be able to pull in?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not sure. None of them seem to frequent our club&#x2026; Oh, but I might&apos;ve seen this person at a sister club&#x2026; Wait a minute, let me check. What&apos;s the name?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sonezaki.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if digging up her memory, Mika made a call on her mobile phone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hello, Sophia? I have something I want to ask you. Do you know a customer named Sonezaki-san?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After chatting like friends for a while, Mika ended the call and nodded.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Bingo. Sophia has a big spender who&apos;s keen on her, and it&apos;s him.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then that&apos;s convenient. Can&apos;t we use him somehow?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What should we do?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This Sonezaki is a married man with two daughters who are in middle school. As a wealthy man, it&apos;s natural for him to have affairs, but he wouldn&apos;t want his family to know about them.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Keep it simple, then.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Try to hit on the rest of the people as much as you can too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Okay.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And one more thing. I want you to get close to Sasada. Lately, it seems his position has been rising. I want to hold one or two weaknesses over him.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sasada, huh? Why?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At the mention of Sasada&apos;s name, Mika&apos;s face couldn&apos;t hide her disgust.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He&apos;s a sleazebag who touches me without permission, you know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is he smitten with you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He even said he&apos;d give me as much money as I want if I spent one night with him.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then that&apos;s perfect. Fulfill his wish. Extract more money from him than he&apos;s expecting.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was a weapon men did not possess&#x2014;a simple yet effective strategy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How much will I get?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you deliver results, it will meet your expectations. Have I ever broken a promise before?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Understood. I&apos;m not keen on it, but I&apos;ll do it well.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And don&apos;t forget to take care of Naoe-sensei. He values you as well.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;I wonder.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was the first time a shadow crossed Mika&apos;s face.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That person, how should I put it&#x2026; no matter how closely I interact with him, I can&apos;t see his true heart.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She picked up a wet towel and began folding it casually.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When the topic was unpleasant, Mika often diverted her attention with this habit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;From my perspective, he&apos;s an old man, but he doesn&apos;t let that show in his energy.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For you to say that much&#x2026; As expected of Naoe-sensei.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, he was a person you shouldn&apos;t underestimate just because of his elderly appearance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Be careful. I don&apos;t want you to get swallowed up.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t tell you how many guys I&apos;ve given that to.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I casually pulled a ten-thousand yen bill from my wallet and placed it messily on the table.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Take it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you leaving already? I still have time, you know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but I don&apos;t have the luxury to stay any longer.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Alcohol and women were mere luxuries in life&#x2014;nothing more, nothing less.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Such things would eventually follow.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What was important now was to perfectly execute the project and make a name for myself in the Naoe faction.</p>",
