It was a class called &apos;Travel&apos; where we used a virtual console.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The children stood up, and all of us put on large goggles.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The view went completely dark. Soon, the screen lit up displaying the program, and then it began.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&quot;Until now, we&apos;ve learned about places like New York and Hawaii in America, but from now on, the curriculum will focus on Japan, starting with basic public transportation.&quot;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The fundamental premise of the class: This world is not just the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This time was still considered a part of our education, and we were told early on that we couldn&apos;t leave here until we became adults.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The virtual console recreated the scenery with such high quality, indistinguishable from reality, in 360 degrees, and the sound combined with the visuals produced a sense of immersion. It even replicated people passing by, such as businessmen in suits, an old man with a cane, and an old woman trying to get into a taxi, showing the cityscape.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, there were also children, but unlike the outside world, there was no playing or enjoyment,</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">just inorganic, mechanical movements.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We learned history and the world&apos;s structure in this place.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Through this activity, when the time came when I&apos;d eventually step into the outside world, I would be able to adapt to things smoothly without having any issues.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I understand it&apos;s necessary, but I think there&apos;s a problem with this method of learning.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">One reason for my reluctance was the uncomfortable feeling that lingered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was commonly referred to as &apos;3D sickness.&apos;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The balance recognized by the vision and the vestibular system was off, and the brain could mistakenly think it was seeing hallucinations.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no way to stop the nausea through just personal effort; the only method was to let the brain learn over time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t so severe that it was impossible to continue, but that was the reason I couldn&apos;t like it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, this virtual console wasn&apos;t only used as a device to visually recognize the outside world.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was also utilized as a tool to train observation and insight.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In various places, we were required to point out what was unnatural in the unfolding stories.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If the spots we pointed to were wrong or if we couldn&apos;t find those spots at all, the instructors would mercilessly correct you.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The methods of correction varied, but they were mainly methods that caused pain.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was&#xa0;why we observe desperately, not sparing even a blink.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The sense of danger sharpened our senses so much that we started to see things we couldn&apos;t see before.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&quot;Then next&#x2014;&quot;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As I was walking through Tokyo on the virtual console, suddenly the screen was enveloped in darkness.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructors&apos; voices that I had been listening to also stopped, and silence enveloped us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Everyone, remove your goggles.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The voice came not through the microphone, but from within the room, and we all followed the instructions at once.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There&apos;s an equipment malfunction. We&apos;ll end today&apos;s virtual console session here. There are still less than thirty minutes until the next curriculum, so please wait here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With those instructions, they collected everyone&apos;s goggles.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Wait here&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Most of the children remained standing. It seemed they intended to kill time by just standing there.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Eventually, it turned out that the equipment issue couldn&apos;t be resolved quickly enough, so the instructors decided to move on to a different curriculum.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The children were, of course, quickly lined up and switched their focus to the next task.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;From now on, I will call out names one by one. Those called will get moving and follow the instructor.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With those instructions, the first three names were called.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Eventually, I was the last to be called. When I was following the instructor, he walked slowly and invited me into a private room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There were no other children. It was just a one-on-one&#xa0;with the instructor.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In the center of the room, there was only a small table and two pipe chairs.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sit down quickly.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wasn&apos;t stopping, but the instructor commanded me to sit down immediately, hitting the table.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I sat in front of the instructor, five cards were laid out in his hand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Each had a different symbol drawn on it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Starting from the left, there was a circle, square, cross, star, and wave&#x2014;five symbols.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I will demonstrate what I want you to do. Observe carefully.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructor, facing me, turned all the cards face down.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since the backs of the five cards had the same pattern, it was impossible to tell which card had which symbol when shuffled like this.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Looks like I&apos;m supposed to identify a specific card among them and reveal it to him.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was what I thought, but&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The five cards were rearranged.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There will only be ten seconds per turn.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Square.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As he spoke, the instructor flipped the card on the far left.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a star.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He got it wrong, but the instructor continued, flipping the cards and stating the symbols.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Circle, star, cross, wave&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From the second to the fifth card, the sequence was wave, square, cross, circle.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Only the fourth card, the cross, was correct. Thus, my accuracy rate was 20%.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This is one cycle, and we will repeat this ten times. Watch carefully.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This task, to correctly guess five times, was repeated ten times. It was a total of fifty guesses.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He continued the same task monotonously.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The final accuracy rate was 30% with fifteen correct answers out of fifty attempts.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Now, it&apos;s your turn, Kiyotaka.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Okay.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I stood up and took the seat, switching places with the instructor who had previously been answering the activity.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>What&apos;s the purpose of this practice?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>It probably isn&apos;t for developing psychic abilities.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>To train intuition?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>No, that seems too straightforward, too realistic.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructor shuffled the five cards.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He always used an overhand shuffle to mix the cards each time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Is this just a habit, or something intentional?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was impossible to determine, and it was easy to dismiss it as meaningless information.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>If there is a meaning, I wonder what it could be.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The material of the desk seemed to suggest that it would be smooth and easy to perform a wash shuffle while the cards were on the table.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Was there a reason he was deliberately using an overhand shuffle?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Another thing that caught my attention was that the instructor didn&apos;t always arrange the cards from the same position.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sometimes, he started from the left end, other times from the middle, then the right end, and then the left again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having watched him ten times, I couldn&apos;t discern any pattern.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I couldn&apos;t dismiss this as mere habit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even upon close inspection, I couldn&apos;t feel any difference from the cards&apos; backs.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed unlikely that either the instructor or I could distinguish them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, there was a significant difference between the instructor and me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was whether one could touch the cards or not.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Only the instructor handled the cards, whether shuffling, dealing, or flipping them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>If he didn&apos;t want me to sense it&#x2026; could it be&#x2026;?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It must&apos;ve been because the instructor could see the cards, which supposedly he shouldn&apos;t have been able to.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, even if he could see them, it didn&apos;t change the fact that I couldn&apos;t.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I wasn&apos;t forbidden from reaching out and touching the cards, but was that the proper move?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">By this point, it had become clear that this wasn&apos;t merely an activity to increase intuition.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Then, a possible rule is&#x2026;</em>&#xa0;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Five cards were laid out, and a ten-second count began.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To increase the accuracy by even 1%, the first symbol I&apos;d say was decided.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Star&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As I answered, the instructor, with an unchanged expression, flipped the card on the far left.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The &apos;star&apos; revealed itself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was still just one out of five.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Wave, square, cross, circle.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From the second to the fifth card, the instructor flipped them as I called out the symbols.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The marks I spoke were turned over as the correct answers.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There are still nine more rounds.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With these five correct answers, I became confident in one rule.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, the rest was easy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From there, I correctly guessed all forty-five cards in the remaining nine rounds.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re 100% accurate&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As the instructor collected the fiftieth card, he looked at me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Emotions that weren&apos;t previously there flickered in his eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t believe you already had a guess from the very first one.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructor, who had first demonstrated the activity, could&apos;ve repeated the same thing once or at most twice just to explain the rules.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, the instructors silently completed all ten rounds regardless of whether he was right or wrong.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t just an explanation of the rules.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was testing memory under the guise of a practice, to see who could quickly realize this.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Plus, perfect memory. It&apos;s hard to believe all of a sudden&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Didn&apos;t you remember too? You arranged the cards the same way as the first time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No way. What I remembered were the small, invisible scratches on the cards. I&apos;m only memorizing the five types. The reason why the arrangement was the same as the first time was due to instructions I&apos;m receiving through an earpiece.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So that&apos;s why there was a camera installed in the ceiling.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;You noticed that too?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I did feel strange about the way I was spoken to earlier.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I entered the room, I was directed to focus my gaze somewhere specific.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Moreover, the urgency with which I was urged to sit down was also unnatural.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If there had been any reason to rush the curriculum, they would&apos;ve hurried me before I entered the room or conducted the demonstration much faster.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re the first one to pass this lesson in one try&#x2026; You can go back.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you&apos;ll excuse me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If I considered today&apos;s lesson as a substitute for the virtual console curriculum, which I didn&apos;t really like, it was several times more enjoyable.</p>",
