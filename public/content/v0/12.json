But there&apos;s delicious-looking sake right in front of me. What is this brand? I&apos;ve never seen it in a pub.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you planning to send off Naoe-sensei with the smell of alcohol? This is nothing more than a formality. Carelessly reaching for it brings no benefit.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In a dazzling high-class <em>ryoutei</em>, being told not to drink sake with a meal&#xa0;right in front of him would feel like torture, but I had no intention of blaming him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In fact, I too had almost succumbed to temptation several times in the past.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Fortunately, at that time, the person who was taking care of me started drinking alcohol, and I witnessed the moment he was reprimanded and <em>erased</em>&#xa0;because of it, which led to my current abstinence. Those in power drink while taking pleasure in watching the people below them suffer&#x2014;or so I came to think.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t just the underling politicians. They looked down on the citizens themselves.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They were always intoxicated with the satisfaction of their desire to conquer, ruling with the rules they created.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji-sensei, there&apos;s something I&apos;ve been wondering about...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>He really is talkative.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why do you always sit in <em>seiza<sup id=\"fnref-1-5a8fb0c9-e4a9-54a0-baa0-a5bc01f9e432\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-5a8fb0c9-e4a9-54a0-baa0-a5bc01f9e432\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup></em>? You can relax your posture at least in this seat.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s a habit. In front of Naoe-sensei and the others, I have to sit in <em>seiza</em>&#xa0;for hours without any trouble. I need to get used to it normally, so I won&apos;t have issues when it&apos;s necessary.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wasn&apos;t even allowed to ask if I could relax my legs.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had no choice but to continue sitting in <em>seiza</em>&#xa0;until my legs necrotized.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s tough...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Apparently not confident, Kamogawa hastily rearranges himself into <em>seiza</em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even a single small egg tofu served on a small plate would cost four digits if ordered by itself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, there was no need to be grateful. I grabbed the small plate roughly and swallowed it without even chewing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What a waste&#x2026;!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I continued eating, ignoring most of the nonsense Kamogawa kept telling me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wasn&apos;t interested in whether it was luxurious, had a beautiful appearance, or what kind of dish it was.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As long as I could consume enough energy to keep moving afterward, that was enough.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m going to the restroom.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I briefly excused myself to Kamogawa, stood up with slightly numb legs, and left the room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After using the restroom and heading back to the private room where Kamogawa was waiting, I spotted the backs of men in suits. Among them was a man who distinctly stood out.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, I only saw him for a moment, and he disappeared around the corner at the end of the hallway.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Was that&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I felt the urge to follow and confirm his identity, but I restrained myself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, that silhouette was definitely Kijima-sensei. Although a minority, he belonged to the Citizens&apos; Party&apos;s fourth faction, unaligned with the other three major factions belonging to Naoe-sensei, Isomaru-sensei, and Prime Minister Miyako.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was the most promising figure among the younger generation and was touted as being closest to becoming the prime minister.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was impossible to call his presence at the same <em>ryoutei</em>&#xa0;a mere coincidence.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Normally, the <em>ryoutei</em>&#xa0;would coordinate discreetly to avoid such clumsy overlaps.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Is Naoe-sensei already starting to make moves toward the next election?</em></p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"5a8fb0c9-e4a9-54a0-baa0-a5bc01f9e432\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-5a8fb0c9-e4a9-54a0-baa0-a5bc01f9e432\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-5a8fb0c9-e4a9-54a0-baa0-a5bc01f9e432\">[1]: </a>Seiza is a formal, traditional Japanese kneeling position that requires the individual to sit on their feet.</p></li></ol>",
