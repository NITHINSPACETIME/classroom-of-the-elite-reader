We basically translated Volume 0 as a test of our procedures before Year 3 starts, and it was also because existing translations were lacking in quality. This is our first translation and we hope it is up to par in quality. This was especially rough, between OCR issues and the MTL doing its own thing. Anyway, I hope it was an enjoyable read, and I am really looking forward to what happens in Year 3. A big shout-out to all the Japanese translators and English editors that joined us and decided to help out with this volume! I would also like to shout out our illustrator who made the covers and the illustrations!</p><p class=\"paragraph\">Also, for the future, <strong>I would like to confirm that we are in fact planning to translate Year 3</strong>. Furthermore, anyone is free to distribute <strong>unmodified</strong> versions of these files. If you have any suggestions for other series we can translate or want to contact us in general, please submit a form on<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.legacyemtls.com/contact-us\"> our website</a>. You can also submit error reports<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.legacyemtls.com/report-error?volume=cote-volume-0\"> here</a> on the website. We welcome any feedback.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">Thanks again and I hope to see you soon for Year 3 Volume 1! Physical raws come out on March 24th and digitals come out around a week later. We&apos;ll start translating during its physical release, and we hope to take at most two weeks for the full translation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">Anyways, Peace!!!</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: right\"><em>Colibri</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\">&#x22c6;&#x22c5;&#x2606;&#x22c5;&#x22c6;</p><p class=\"paragraph\">Yo, FS7 here, another lead.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">If you happened to stumble upon a copy of this without understanding what LegacyEMTLs is, I&apos;ll explain.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">With Royal dead and gone, another quality translator needs to take up the mantle. We aim to do that with the same methods that Royal publicly disclosed. Since other translators are not the best. And raw MTL isn&apos;t ideal.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">Ideally, we can stick around longer&#x2014;we&apos;ve taken measures to do so.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">Additionally, we became aware of other inferior TL groups taking the old RoyalMTLs translations, rephrasing them using AI and claiming them as their own work, and either charging or asking for donations for work that isn&apos;t theirs.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">In case this happens with the LegacyEMTLs group, we want to preemptively state that we will never charge money to access our translations, nor will we ever lock them behind ad-filled link shorteners.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">We believe our translations to be superior, and well worth the wait, at least until officials catch up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">Thanks, and see you for Year 3.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: right\"><em>FS7</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\">&#x22c6;&#x22c5;&#x2606;&#x22c5;&#x22c6;</p><p class=\"paragraph\">One more lead here, F2P2W.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">The others have said a lot already, so I don&apos;t have much left to say. The team is full of people taking on multiple things at once&#x2014;whether that be school, jobs, or personal projects&#x2014;all while working on LegacyEMTLs, so please be kind to the team~</p><p class=\"paragraph\">We strive to be as good if not better than Royal&apos;s quality, constantly improving both our machine&apos;s intelligence and our personal skills. Of course, there will be mistakes, but we&apos;ll try to fix things as soon as we become aware of them. Please remember that we are an edited MTLs group and not an official licensor or translation group. That may sound obvious, but that means we do things to prioritize time and efficiency while keeping a decent quality level. Whether you like it or not, Seven Seas will do the official translations, Volume 0 aside, and they will be the ones to jazz things up structurally and such.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">That being said, we hope to bring good quality reads for those patiently waiting for the Seven Seas official translations! And I hope you all win your 50/50s early pity~</p><p class=\"paragraph\">Signing out~</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: right\"><em>F2P2W</em></p>",
