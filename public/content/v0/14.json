Put Ooba&#xa0;on. I have a new job for him.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">First, I needed to think of an approach using whatever pieces I could, regardless of morality.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After Ooba answered the phone, I explained that I was looking for ways to acquire newborns and asked for his advice on what to do.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But contacting Ooba meant that using evil means was unavoidable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">During the conversation, a buzzer-like chime sounded.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, I&apos;ll contact you again.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I ended the conversation with Ooba midway and decided to attend to the visitor.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Good morning. It&apos;s Kamogawa. Are you there, Ayanokouji-san?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Come in. I didn&apos;t lock the door.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you&apos;ll excuse me&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In a shabby office near the city center, costing about a hundred thousand yen in rent, Kamogawa showed a gloomy face.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Uwahh.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As soon as he opened the door, Kamogawa showed a blatantly disrespectful attitude.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, I didn&apos;t bother to point it out each time. It was a common reaction among visitors.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you perhaps living in this office, Ayanokouji-san? It kind of smells like it&apos;s been lived in&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The beer cans scattered at my feet, the unwashed sheets on the worn sofa, and the clothes carelessly thrown off would easily suggest as much even to a child.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What about it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, it&apos;s not that there&apos;s a problem&#x2026; It&apos;s just not like you&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Does it not match a Diet member&apos;s annual salary?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A Diet member&apos;s monthly salary easily exceeded a million yen. With the proportionate bonuses, the total could exceed twenty million yen a year. Various allowances were also provided under different names.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;My colleague Kisarazu-san, who is three years older than me, boasted about how he signed a contract for the top floor of a tower mansion<sup id=\"fnref-1-aa7ddf7c-ffac-5257-8176-5bdc68f206c9\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-aa7ddf7c-ffac-5257-8176-5bdc68f206c9\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup>&#xa0;in the city center just a week after becoming a member of Diet. Even a loan that normally wouldn&apos;t pass, he got approved in one shot.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not because he&apos;s a Diet member.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Indeed, a Diet member&apos;s salary is high when you look at it from the perspective of your average company. However, whether it&apos;s the House of Representatives or the Senate, they&apos;re forced to face elections every few years. A bank wouldn&apos;t lend large amounts of money just based on the title to such an unstable job.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But Kisarazu-san got it approved&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The loan amount, the bank involved, and the connections&#x2014;there are plenty of conditions that can be arranged to get it approved.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh, I see&#x2026; I wouldn&apos;t get approved, huh&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was the opposite. Indeed, Kamogawa himself might have a lower individual rating than Kisarazu, but the banks would see through to his father, Kamogawa Toshizou.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If they heard he was looking for a loan, bank employees from several banks would likely come to meet Kamogawa.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, they&apos;d even bring a box of sweets or two.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How trivial.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Trivial, you say? Doesn&apos;t everyone aspire to live in a luxury tower mansion?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kamogawa. I&apos;m telling you this for your own good, don&apos;t mimic the likes of Kisarazu.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If he were a member of Diet just for the money, it wouldn&apos;t be surprising to see him spend it on such trivial things.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not saying don&apos;t buy real estate. I&apos;m just saying don&apos;t miss the right timing. Money is finite, but it holds infinite possibilities.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa, despite not quite understanding, nodded as if he did.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you suddenly had a hundred million yen in front of you, what would you do?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh? A hundred million yen? I&apos;d save about ninety million, and spend ten million on fun stuff, like going to hostess clubs or buying a car. Maybe I&apos;d even invest a bit in stocks. If I had two hundred million, I&apos;d buy a mansion.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In a way, it was a typical response. However, it was no different from Kisarazu in its triviality.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;d use it differently, right, Ayanokouji-san? What would you do?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Figure it out yourself.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh~? Come on, tell me~&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If I suddenly had a hundred million yen, I&apos;d probably spend it all within a few days.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As a means to connect with the financial world, there were various methods of investment for the future. This included acquisitions and bribes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no time to spend money on an office or home when even a small change was precious.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The hundred million yen invested upfront should come back as a significantly larger return in a few years or decades.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And if that came along with the title of the nation&apos;s most powerful position&#x2014;the final destination&#x2014;then it was perfect.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So, what are you here for?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How can you say that? I&apos;m here to help you, Ayanokouji-san, just as Naoe-sensei instructed.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t need it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That won&apos;t do. I&apos;m one of the people who heard about that project. I don&apos;t mind if you take all the credit, but I&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa might live clumsily and awkwardly, but his desire for achievement was understandable. Indeed, it wasn&apos;t easy to find such opportunities. However, being a Diet member is fundamentally a job without the concept of days off. They were non-permanent <em>tokubetsu shoku<sup id=\"fnref-2-85cbf0f7-0023-56d1-84b4-447df75b0efc\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-2-85cbf0f7-0023-56d1-84b4-447df75b0efc\" data-ref=\"2\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[2]</a></sup></em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Moreover, it was currently the parliamentary session. Participating in policy study groups and research meetings within the Citizens&apos; Party, attending to supporters and petitioners, and managing political and official duties filled most of the schedule.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Can you be of use?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ll show you I can be. After all, I&apos;m still Kamogawa Toshizou&apos;s son, you know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>That said, your father hasn&apos;t left much of a mark in the political world.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>But I guess I can&apos;t just casually ignore Naoe-sensei&apos;s instructions.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then, as you wish, let&apos;s see you be of use. I&apos;ll give you a task.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa&apos;s eyes sparkled, having never been given a significant role before.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What kind of job is it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For the project in question, it&apos;s essential to secure an experimental facility. I&apos;ll leave the location selection to you. Consider the scale, budget, and whether it can avoid public attention. If that goes well, you&apos;ll move on to the next task. You want to be a respectable Diet member recognized by Naoe-sensei, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah, I see. Indeed, that&apos;s something unavoidable.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even if it doesn&apos;t match the scale of ANHS, we need to increase the number of children annually. Naturally, you have to choose a suitable size. Moreover, maintaining anonymity is also crucial.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This project couldn&apos;t be promoted on a large scale.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We had to prevent journalists from reporting it as dangerous education for infants.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;From a budgetary perspective, seems like it&apos;ll inevitably be in the countryside.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kamogawa&apos;s foolish expression changed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was a man who had been soaking in lukewarm water<sup id=\"fnref-3-78ac79c9-a744-5847-bcea-24b127d0fcd6\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-3-78ac79c9-a744-5847-bcea-24b127d0fcd6\" data-ref=\"3\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[3]</a></sup>, but he didn&apos;t find joy in being called a second-generation politician. <em>If given the right job and the right words of praise, he might be somewhat useful. No, he has to be.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I understand. I&apos;ll try.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s good. You&apos;ve finally made a decent face.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is that so?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A little praise, and that decent face quickly retreated.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What will you do now, Ayanokouji-san?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;First and foremost, money is essential to planning the facility. I&apos;ll start preparing for that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The conditions we envisioned would require a considerable cost at the initial stage.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Additionally, including personnel recruitment, I wanted to prepare about five hundred million.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>If we wanted to be safe, we&apos;d need over six hundred or seven hundred million&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You mean you&apos;re going to talk about this project and get funding that way, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course, that&apos;s the aim.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;They&apos;d be pleased to provide gifted education to children, wouldn&apos;t they?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He really couldn&apos;t see the future.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Who would invest in a project that&apos;s still at its conceptual stage, when it&apos;s just a few pieces of paper?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if we were just talking about the wealthy, it wasn&apos;t an amount they would easily part with.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, politicians couldn&apos;t officially receive direct donations, so they&apos;d have to go through organizations like support groups.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There were limits to receiving donations, but finding a politician who strictly adhered to them was harder. There were countless ways to circumvent donation limits.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, even on such a flimsy basis, with just a couple of words, if Naoe-sensei were to simply say, &apos;Do it,&apos; a large sum of money would miraculously appear.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since that wasn&apos;t an option, finding a major investor to start with was urgent business.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Even if my influence isn&apos;t on Naoe-sensei&apos;s level, I only have to be able to make an investor believe that he&apos;ll invest.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>If I can achieve that, raising nearly five hundred million won&apos;t be impossible.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I sent Kamogawa off to work as if I were pushing him out of the office, and I took out three bankbooks from the desk. There were deposits from three different local banks.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;All together&#x2026; it&apos;s just under ten million.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t a very dependable war chest, but it was all I had to start hitting targets with.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"aa7ddf7c-ffac-5257-8176-5bdc68f206c9\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-aa7ddf7c-ffac-5257-8176-5bdc68f206c9\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-aa7ddf7c-ffac-5257-8176-5bdc68f206c9\">[1]: </a>A &quot;tower mansion&quot; is a Japanese term referring to tall condominiums that are at least twenty floors high.</p></li><li data-id=\"85cbf0f7-0023-56d1-84b4-447df75b0efc\" data-ref=\"2\" class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-2-85cbf0f7-0023-56d1-84b4-447df75b0efc\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-2-85cbf0f7-0023-56d1-84b4-447df75b0efc\">[2]: </a>Tokubetsu shoku is a special position in the Japanese civil service that&apos;s exempted from application of the Local Public Service Act.</p></li><li data-id=\"78ac79c9-a744-5847-bcea-24b127d0fcd6\" data-ref=\"3\" class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-3-78ac79c9-a744-5847-bcea-24b127d0fcd6\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-3-78ac79c9-a744-5847-bcea-24b127d0fcd6\">[3]: </a>&quot;Soaking in lukewarm water&quot; is a Japanese idiom that conveys that the individual &quot;soaking&quot; is staying in a comfortable and risk-free environment, suggesting that they don&apos;t need to work much.</p></li></ol>",
