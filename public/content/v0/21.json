Afterward, Kamogawa came.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Good work, Ayanokouji-san. As for the important piece&#x2014;the children&#x2026; is the arrangement progressing?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It wouldn&apos;t start if it wasn&apos;t progressing. The scheme is almost complete.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah, I see&#x2026; of course, you don&apos;t have to tell me the details. I still, uh, don&apos;t want to get caught.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The method I was using to gather children, the one that I hadn&apos;t told Kamogawa about&#x2014;it involved using the Ooba group to illegally obtain newborns from underground brokers.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, this carried many risks. Therefore, eventually, we would have to switch to legitimate means of gathering children.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>It&apos;s still in the planning stage, but in the near future, a homepage will be launched, announcing that it will serve as a place to take in children for parents who, due to unavoidable circumstances, are unable to raise their children.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ideally, cooperation would start before birth. There were women who, unable to rely on the country&apos;s system and unable to afford the costs, couldn&apos;t manage. There are more than a few cases where they quietly gave birth and let the child die. In theory, it was possible, but it also carried significant risks. The moment when a child is conceived, they wouldn&apos;t truly be a parent yet. Even if they thought they couldn&apos;t give birth or raise the child, there were many cases where they&apos;d end up becoming a mother upon facing the child.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And what if there was a fatal accident?&#xa0;If sued to return their child, it could lead back to the White Room. That had to be avoided.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If it became public, it would cause more than just damage to Naoe-sensei&apos;s reputation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was crucial to only take children from those who gave birth elsewhere, who weren&apos;t responsible, and who couldn&apos;t become mothers.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>The website&apos;s homepage should be filled with beautiful, hypocritical phrases&#x2014;&apos;Don&apos;t take lives,&apos; &apos;We accept babies anonymously,&apos; &apos;Consultation for financial difficulties,&apos; &apos;Foster care system,&apos; and other slogans that promise a future for themselves and their children.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When visiting the hospital, mothers would first be allowed to meet without being asked for their names or addresses, just letting them state why they can&apos;t freely raise their child. If it was merely a child they couldn&apos;t openly give birth to, some might readily agree to foster care. If they were struggling with money, it might&apos;ve been okay to give them some cash. When handing over a child to the hospital, a week&apos;s grace period would always be set. The next day or later, some parents may appear, beginning to regret giving up their child.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Thus, unrecognized children would be gathered and sent to the White Room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if, two or three years later, we were asked to return their child, it wouldn&apos;t matter as long as connections with each mother were maintained only in the form of names.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, it wouldn&apos;t make sense to return a child they gave to foster care.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since we were doing something illegal, we had to avoid making it public.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Handling children as a product was extremely delicate and difficult.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Rather, what comes after is where the problem&apos;s at&#x2014;the medical care for the children brought to the White Room.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Medical care&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Children are fragile. They fall ill from small things. Though, since it&apos;s difficult to take them to a hospital, having doctors who can treat them within the White Room is essential.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Not just any doctor would do.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>There are several conditions: the doctor must be stripped of their medical license, be flexible in thinking, preferably be in their older years but not too old, and be able to reacquire a medical license if necessary. Also, they should be struggling financially or have a strong resistance against working legitimately in the outside world.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That sounds&#x2026; quite difficult. It&apos;s not exactly clean&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s understandable to think so. But all over Japan, you&apos;ll find people with unexpected backgrounds if you search for them. In the search, a former doctor living deep in Tottori&apos;s mountains was found. He had a history that involved causing a traffic accident that killed two college students riding a moped.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Accidents weren&apos;t rare. Coming home after a night of hard work, the sleepy doctor started a right turn without properly judging the distance to an oncoming bike and collided. He immediately arranged for police and an ambulance, but it was too late. Unfortunately, the victims were children of a well-known local landowner, and he had to flee to an unrelated area to escape people&apos;s eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s been ten years since that incident. It&apos;s possible to reacquire his medical license, but he&apos;s been drowning his days in alcohol.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Such a person&#x2026; Though, while it&apos;s good news that he&apos;s found, there has to be some concerns, aren&apos;t there?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Originally, he was a flashy guy and spent money lavishly. That&apos;s what we&apos;re after.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At least one person. Ideally, another one too.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We needed to secure doctors who could manage the children&apos;s health.</p>",
