However, more often than not, children who fell noticeably behind would once again stumble at that next step.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The adults certainly weren&apos;t welcoming of the children&apos;s failures.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, they couldn&apos;t keep the children who couldn&apos;t match the pace in the same place forever.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Leaving those children behind would create discord, and if they adjusted to them instead, they&apos;d be disrupting the rhythm of the children who were ahead.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The next learning opportunity would be lost.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was &apos;thinning out&apos; the children must&apos;ve been inevitable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&quot;Ten minutes remaining.&quot;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Before the thinning process, among the regular tests, there was a special, high-difficulty written curriculum that applied to one of them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was something I noticed during our repeated studies every day. The difficulty of this special written exam was raised to match the top score. In other words, if someone scored full marks, the standard would slide up, and children who scored low would be forced to struggle even more in the next test.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Conversely, if the top score was less than perfect, the ceiling would be lowered accordingly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter how tough the questions were, trivial calculation errors, careless oversights, and excuses were absolutely unacceptable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Therefore, even after finishing all the questions within the time limit, the children repeatedly checked their answers.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If there was even a single flaw, it was over, so they desperately clung to their test papers.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Amidst the hustle and bustle of those around me, I continued to stare straight ahead, holding my pen and pretending to take the exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In reality, I had already filled out all the answers and was spending the remaining time meaninglessly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wasn&apos;t anxious about any possible writing mistakes because I hadn&apos;t made any.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The questions on the exam paper and the answers I had written were etched word for word in my mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&quot;Five minutes remaining.&quot;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Alongside the announcement, the sound of pens around me intensified. Perhaps due to mental distress, I could hear the sound of an eraser being rubbed harder from the seat next to mine.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Compared to the previous exam, this one had increased in difficulty by several levels.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Our math lessons came, and when I was solving the problems, such as the conditions for equality between the arithmetic and geometric means, an incident occurred.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With nearly half of the required thirty minutes left, I had finished answering the final question and continued to stare straight ahead, waiting for the signal for the exam to end.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Suddenly, a man, a representative of the White Room, entered the room with a stern look.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t unprecedented for an adult to appear during an exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It happened when someone couldn&apos;t keep up with the exam and fainted from hyperventilation, or had convulsions or seizures.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">So far, there weren&apos;t any signs of such a child.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Or perhaps, although it was very rare, someone became so focused on solving the problems that they recklessly resorted to cheating.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, I soon realized that his target was none other than me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He stopped a short distance in front of me to the left, took a single glance at my exam paper, and then looked at me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kiyotaka.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Called by my name, I looked up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Remember this well. It is foolish not to use the power you have.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was clear what I had been doing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Leave the room.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having been ordered to do so, I followed the man out of the room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What were you thinking, Kiyotaka?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You know what I mean. You&apos;re not someone who can&apos;t understand the intent of my question.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was seated in a small private room, and the man continued.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It seems you&apos;ve finished all the questions.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you confident that it&apos;s a perfect score?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I thought so.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I intentionally held back to score eighty points on the test.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why did you hold back?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I wasn&apos;t instructed not to.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I knew that failing to score full marks on this test wouldn&apos;t get me dropped.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You are aware that you&apos;re in the lead this term, aren&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then, there must be a reason why you held back.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The man pointed at me and answered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Did you realize the curriculum&apos;s mechanism? If you score full marks, the difficulty of the special curriculum for the fourth-generation students increases. And naturally, more would drop out. Did you want to prevent that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">His answer was correct.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Could it be that you&apos;ve grown a sense of camaraderie towards those children?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I see. So that&apos;s the conclusion the adults reached.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Did it appear so?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes, it did.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How did Ayanokouji-sensei feel about it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was interested in the answer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Slacking off to help comrades isn&apos;t really helping at all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Is that really true?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I questioned myself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s wrong.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And I denied him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then try to convince me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Commanded to do so, I expressed my own thoughts.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In the first place, I&apos;ve never once recognized the other children around me as comrades.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then why didn&apos;t you try to get a perfect score?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I had already predicted that I would get a perfect score this time, and the instructors understood that as well. Therefore, there was no need to write the answer down every time. It was more time-efficient to leave it blank.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a waste to spend effort where it was unnecessary.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s presumptuous. Knowledge fades over time. That&apos;s why you always have to give it your full effort not to forget. Even if you have the ability to score perfectly on the test, errors and mistakes can happen. We need to see you at your best at all times.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I won&apos;t make a mistake.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re quite sure of yourself.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Besides, I held back for a different reason.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If I hadn&apos;t held back, the percentage of children dropping out would have been much higher than it is now. In other words, by holding back, children who would normally drop out still exist in this world.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s what they call a sense of camaraderie.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No. Losing experience&#x2014;that&apos;s how I thought of it. It would mean losing the opportunity to interact with the children who would drop out.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The instructors exchanged puzzled looks.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My brain, craving knowledge, wanted to analyze both patterns and sought an answer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It would be easy to cut them off at this stage. However, I am still in the learning phase. I want to know what the weak can see and feel.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is it premature to make them drop out here?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I nodded. Soon, many of the children around me wouldn&apos;t be able to keep up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do you think you stand above us just because you&apos;ve acquired some knowledge? That&apos;s not for you to decide. The selection is for us to make.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course. Everything depends on the way the White Room&apos;s structured.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This man&apos;s attempt to crush me with logic was futile.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was never a rule stating that you couldn&apos;t slack off.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It also wouldn&apos;t be easy to add such a rule.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if I scored a zero, it would ultimately be up to the instructors to determine if I was being lazy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They wouldn&apos;t fail me for that. However, of course, they couldn&apos;t treat someone who scored a zero as if they scored a hundred.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Isn&apos;t it fine? If he thinks this way, why not observe him?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you think, Suzukake?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I agree with Ishida-san. If he does something we hadn&apos;t even considered, that&apos;s exactly what we hoped for.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The man fell silent for a while, then dropped his gaze on me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do as you like. However, remember the words I said.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>It is foolish not to use the power you have.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whether that was true or not, I decided to remember it as one point of interest.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At the same time, another emotion began to show.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was the feeling that I was starting to dislike this man.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I could slightly understand Yuki&apos;s feelings, how she said she hated carrots.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As I returned to the room and took my seat, a buzzer sounded.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At the same time, the children all placed the pens they had been holding onto their desks.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was the rule. The agreement.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, even after the buzzer sounded, the sound of one pen scratching paper had yet to cease.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This wasn&apos;t unusual.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">One boy continued the test while gasping for breath and sobbing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even as the automatic doors opened and adults entered, he maintained his position, continuing the test.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though, he was forcibly grabbed by the right arm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No! Let go! No! I can still do it! I can solve it! No, no, no! I don&apos;t want to drop out!!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Overwhelmed by excessive pressure and realizing his own defeat, he scattered his gastric fluids over the test paper.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The gastric fluid also adhered to his own neck and clothes, but the adults, unconcerned, restrained him from both sides and dragged him out without caring about the resisting child. The children here were emotionless, but there was an exception when it came time for them to drop out. The imminent threat of death would awaken their survival instincts, causing them to lose their reason. Some did look his way, but most didn&apos;t take any action and just stared ahead.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Uwaaaaaaa! Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He let out a scream unlike any heard before towards the other side of the automatic door, echoing through the room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As he was taken away, the door closed immediately and silence returned.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>They really don&apos;t understand anything.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In this special curriculum exam, no matter what score you got, you wouldn&apos;t drop out.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If they couldn&apos;t even distinguish this difference, it was inevitable that they would get kicked out here.</p>",
