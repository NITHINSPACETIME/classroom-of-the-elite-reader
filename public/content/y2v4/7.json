Well, I guess people don’t really call them that anymore. They say “child of in vitro fertilization” or something. Anyway, I’m someone born from in vitro fertilization. But aside from that, I really don’t know anything else about myself. I’ve never even seen my parents’ faces. Not even once. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Where are they now? What are they doing? Why did they put me in the White Room? I don’t know the answers to any of those questions, and, well, to be blunt, I’m not interested. There was one thing I was told, though, when I was old enough to understand it: I was told that my parents were extremely brilliant people. That meant I was an extremely blessed child, born with the genetic means to become a genius. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">But my existence conflicts with the philosophy of the White Room. The ultimate goal of the facility is to nurture all people equally, raising them to identical excellence. Their aim is to prove that human limits aren’t determined by genetics, but, rather, that they are determined by environment. They didn’t want someone like me, a child with superior genes, to be the only one with outstanding talents. I’m sure that my existence was probably just one of many “experiments” they were doing in the White Room.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I’m not rejecting the idea behind those experiments or whatever, but did they seriously think it could be done? Personally, I concluded that it was impossible to make everyone identical in all things like intelligence, personality, and mentality. I mean, the fact that I exist right now, as myself, is the best proof of that, right?</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ever since I was really little, I prided myself on the fact that, deep down, I was so completely different from everyone around me. Even though I hid the fire in my eyes and pretended to be completely disinterested in everything, just doing what was asked of me, I always had my doubts about the institution’s whole raison d’être. Did I want to grow and mature for the sake of the White Room’s ideal, foundational principles? To stake my life so that I could make a contribution to their data?</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Do I really want to be the absolute best success story for the organization and devote my entire life to achieving that standard, day in and day out? I mean, don’t you think that all sounds kind of sad? You’d want to live more freely too, right? Well, I do, at least. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life trapped in that world.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Oh well, that’s probably all moot now anyway. Let’s get back to the topic at hand, ’kay? Even among those in the White Room, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka was someone who stood far above the rest. He had an incredible record. Of course, when I first heard about him, I was skeptical. How could I believe that he had surpassed me in every way, beating every score that I had worked myself to the bone to get?</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">But… Yeah. When I looked at the data and saw him in real life, and when I finally talked to him, I understood. I&#160;knew that he was special after all.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It’s just… I’m sorry, senpai. I really wanted to be your ally, but I guess that’s not going to happen. It’s like, I spent way, </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">way</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> more time there than I have together with you, senpai. You know, I… I guess I’m more compassionate than I thought I was, huh?</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Senpai, speaking as someone who worships you, I’ll be watching you from a distance until </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">that</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> time comes. Okay?</span></p>\n",
