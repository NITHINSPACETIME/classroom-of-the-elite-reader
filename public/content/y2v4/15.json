And yet, there’s just one project after another, endlessly, and that infinite growth continues to sap my physical and mental strength, day by day… </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Oh, hello there. This is Kinugasa.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">…Hm.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I…don’t have anything to write about in the postscript!</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Well, uh, my right thumb has been throbbing in pain lately. (It’s probably not gout.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Oh, and there’s this spicy curry place that opened in my neighborhood! It’s so good that I can’t help myself from going there. (Yeah, who cares?)</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Or, uh, there’s the time that, after staring really hard at the website of a delivery place for like an hour, thinking about how I wanted to get some lunch delivered, I ended up riding my bike there and picking it up anyway after considering the additional charges and the delivery fees. (So what?)</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">There haven’t been any particularly new or notable changes. I’ve just been going about my day-to-day life as it comes. Yep. That’s all. I guess that’s about it for recent updates? Thank you for your understanding that, as usual, this is a postscript without much in the way of actual content.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Anyway, this book was about the second half of the uninhabited island special exam. This was the fourth volume of the second-year arc, but looking back, both this book and the previous one really are massive! At any rate, even though I wrote close to 700 pages between the two books, there were still many, many more episodes that I wanted to write about. I wanted to write about the battles happening between many of the main characters on the uninhabited island, but I couldn’t do that, since that would have taken the action away from the main story, so…</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">If there’s a demand for it, I think I’d like to try and write out episodes for each character individually, but I’m not really sure if anyone wants that, so I figure I’ll just ignore that idea for now. In the main story of volume four, we saw the battle with Tsukishiro come to a close, at least for the time being. However, the story connected to the White Room is still going to continue for a little while longer yet. I’m sure that those of you who have been reading along have some guesses about what’s to come.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The next volume—which will be volume 4.5—will show what happens following the special exam as the students spend their summer vacation on a luxury cruise ship. I hope you’ll pay close attention to the details of the uninhabited island exam, as well as to episodes about characters that haven’t previously been mentioned. There may or may not be changes in the love lives of Ayanokouji and other characters. And even matters about the White Room, which I touched on earlier, might…</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Well, as I said earlier, it’s going to be a summer vacation story, but I’m also planning to include several significant developments, not unlike during the uninhabited island exam, so please look forward to it. And with that, everyone, let’s meet again in about four months’ time, at the latest.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I’m looking forward to bringing you more stories in 2021.</span></p>\n",
