Syougo Kinugasa here. It’s been four months, and volume five has been released. To be honest, I planned to get it out earlier, but it ended up taking four months to finish. “Earlier next time for sure” is what I’d like to say, but since nothing good will really come of me declaring that, I won’t.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">In this volume, the second semester begins, and the opening act is the battle of the sports festival. This time, the protagonist acted behind the scenes. The story focused mainly on the class as a whole, with Horikita in the lead. Someone who knows about the protagonist’s past also finally appeared! Furthermore, volume five includes the catalyst that makes the rest of the school aware of the protagonist’s existence. The story is most definitely still in its early stages, but I’m going to keep on working hard on it, so please look forward to the rest.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Quite a few people have helped me over the last year, most of all my illustrator, Tomoseshunsaku-sama. And even though I call him pointlessly, and we end up chatting a bunch, I’m also greatly indebted to my editor, who is the most reliable of all. I sincerely hope that we have another good year.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">To my readers, and all associated parties—I look forward to what the new year brings you.</span></p>\n",
