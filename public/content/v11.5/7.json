How much time had I even spent talking to my brother at this school? We’d been here together for a full year, and I was sure it didn’t even total a couple of hours. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Our relationship was far too tenuous. People might mock me for it, saying my relationship with my brother hardly even qualified as friendship, and there wasn’t much I could say in reply. We were siblings. That might seem like a close connection, but in reality, we were so far apart from each other that it was hard to even imagine we shared blood.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Is it really okay to part ways while things are like this?” I asked myself, posing the question to my reflection in the mirror.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">My reflection didn’t answer, of course. It was just me, staring back with a depressed expression. I didn’t even need to meet my reflection’s eyes to know that she was trying to bring something to my attention. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">There were so many things I wanted to talk to my brother about. I couldn’t even begin to list them all. I&#160;couldn’t possibly part ways with him now, with things being what they were. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Or so I’d thought. And then a year went by, and in the end, I couldn’t even make time for us to talk. But…things were different now. We could face each other now. I could meet him confidently, without hesitation. I could meet him proudly and we could say our final goodbyes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“…No. It’s just no use.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I wasn’t even qualified to say goodbye to him right now. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It was certainly true that our relationship had changed. I’d been able to get my brother to look at me. But… </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I’d barely been able to show my brother how much I’d grown this past year. Even if I did manage to say goodbye to him now, I was sure it wouldn’t make him happy. If anything, it would only end up making him worry about his incompetent little sister. I couldn’t sully the three dazzling years my brother had spent here with feelings like that.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Maybe it would be better if we didn’t meet up at all? I&#160;ended up thinking to myself. I couldn’t bother him with my selfishness…</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“No. That’s not right. That can’t be better, can it?” I&#160;said aloud, once again posing my question to my reflection in the mirror.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I couldn’t show him what I wanted to. Even so, that didn’t mean running away was the right answer. If I could confidently tell my brother that I was all right, everything would be okay. So what would I do? What should I do? I didn’t have much time left. I really wished I’d noticed my own foolishness much sooner. What if I had noticed&#160;it right after I had started school here?</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“There’s no point in second-guessing what’s already happened, I suppose…”</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It was now after eight o’clock in the morning. My brother would be leaving today at noon.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“What do I do…? What should I do?” I asked myself.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I’d thought that everything would be okay if I just showed him myself, as I am right now. But the person I was right now wasn’t the real me. I was just an incredibly foolish little sister who’d been doing nothing but chasing after her big brother. My reflection in the mirror seemed to overlap with my past self.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“Who…in the world…am I?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">That was right. The person reflected in the mirror was me, but it was not me. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“…A fake.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">In this moment, I was a fake. Thinking back, I’d spent more than half of my life living as an imposter. I’d been hiding who I really was, pretending to be someone I wasn’t. Pretending to be the little sister that my brother wanted. My outward appearance, my personality, my grades, everything—they were all for my brother.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">An imposter I had created to be accepted by my brother. But there was no way my brother would ever accept such an imitation. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">No, that wasn’t right. The person I’d been for all these years was most definitely me. I couldn’t call that an imitation. It was my true self, one I’d spent half my life with, although that was admittedly still a short period of time. I didn’t regret who I was now. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">But…</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“What I want to show him… What I really wanted my brother to see was…”</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">There was only one thing I could show him. I thought I could finally see what that was, now.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“…Thank you. My false, yet unmistakably real, self.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I bowed to the mirror and my reflection in it. My long hair swayed. Then, I brought my head back up and looked away from the mirror. I was done facing my past self. There was no more time for that. </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I had something I had to do, as myself. It was something I’d noticed right at the very last moment. A final gift for my brother, so that he could leave in peace.</span></p>\n",
