I just wanted you all to please take note of that point first and foremost. While I wanted to write about what was going on with the other students scattered about in the other parts of the island, the page count ballooned before I had even realized it and I hit the page limit. I’m starting to become painfully aware that there are limits to what I can put into just one book.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">When I started writing, I sometimes thought to myself, rather optimistically, </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Hey, it’d be fine if I went a little over the page limit, right? What’s the big deal? </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">But in many of my books, I found myself really fighting those remaining pages, trying to figure out what to put on them. Why can’t they just make an exception for </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Classroom</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> and let me write over 500 pages per</span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">—</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em; color: #4D5156;\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">No, no, let’s stop right there. I’d just end up hurting myself for no good reason by fighting for that. Actually, I think I’d be just fine with a fifty-page increase instead!</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">All right, all right. I know that introductory part got pretty long, so I only have a little bit left for the actual postscript this time. In all honesty, I think this book would be fine even without a postscript this time. Right? I mean, is there even anybody out there who is actually sticking around to read these? I wonder about that each time I put out a book…but I also kinda don’t like it that the page that comes </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">right</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> after the end of the story is the postscript. But there aren’t enough pages without it, so I don’t have much choice.</span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The end of 2020 is in sight, but I’ll keep working hard through the end of the year! See you next time!</span></p>\n",
