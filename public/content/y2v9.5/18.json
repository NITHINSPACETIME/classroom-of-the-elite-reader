class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.1\">Students from Horikita’s class, including Sudou and some others who didn’t have any club activities today, gathered at a café in Keyaki Mall. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.2\">There were a total of eight people present: Ike, Sudou, Shinohara, Matsushita, Mori, Wang, Maezono, and Onodera. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.3\">It was Maezono who had suggested they meet up. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.4\">Everyone cocked their heads to the side in confusion when she proposed they get together, saying that she wanted to “have an important discussion about the future of the class.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.5\">First and foremost, it was far too serious a topic for Maezono to be bringing up, given how she was. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.6\">Secondly, the usual key players of the class were intentionally excluded from the meeting.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.1\">Why had people like Horikita and Hirata, central figures of the class, not been invited? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.2\">They were people who, by nature, were indispensable in discussing the class’s future. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.3\">Most of the eight people chosen for this meeting didn’t have a strong reluctance toward the idea of getting together, and had accepted Maezono’s invitation thinking that it was partly just to hang out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.4\">It was Matsushita alone who had some suspicions about this meeting from beginning to end. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.5\">However, she didn’t mention these suspicions to Maezono directly, and, at least ostensibly, had accepted the invitation from Maezono just like the other six did, as something coming from a friend. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.6\">She decided to act as though she was simply showing up for a meeting, and nothing else.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.1\">Perhaps because eight people were invited to this meeting, a relatively large number, Maezono had decided that the meeting place would be a café in Keyaki Mall. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.2\">When the appointed time came, at 11:30 that morning, six of the eight had gathered—everyone except for Ike and Shinohara. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.3\">Upon seeing who else had gathered for the meeting, Matsushita’s suspicions grew. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.4\">She wondered not only about the people chosen for this meeting, but also whether they could really discuss the future of the class somewhere so public. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.5\">From the outset, she didn’t believe that there would be a substantive discussion because of Maezono’s personality and abilities.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.1\">Even so, if Maezono was going to label this discussion as important, then Matsushita wanted her to at least be more careful about the location. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.2\">But Maezono showed no signs of understanding what was going through Matsushita’s mind. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.3\">Instead, she simply roared with laughter as she excitedly talked about what she saw on TV yesterday. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.4\">Matsushita was relatively close with Maezono and seemed to be in even better spirits lately than before.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.1\">“Sorry to have kept you waiting!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.2\">said Shinohara.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.1\">Matsushita put those thoughts aside as Ike and Shinohara showed up, having arrived somewhat late. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.2\">The two of them looked quite familiar, holding hands, and they sat down side-by-side on two chairs that had been left open out of consideration for the fact they were a couple.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.1\">Sudou, though taken aback by the degree of passion of their love, made a jab at Ike. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.2\">“Come on you two, don’t be doin’ PDA in the middle of the day, jeez. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.3\">More importantly, yer late!”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.1\">“Heh heh heh, come on, dude, it’s not like that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.2\">Right, Satsuki?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.3\">said Ike.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.1\">“That’s right, we’re being totally normal,” said Shinohara. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.2\">“Besides, Sudou-kun, you’ve got quite the history of being late, don’t you?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.1\">Sudou let out a sigh as he watched the two of them sit down, still not letting go of each other’s hands. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.2\">“I ain’t been late lately though,” he replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.3\">It didn’t seem like his words reached Shinohara or Ike’s ears, though.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.1\">“Hey,” said Maezono quietly, “those two…” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.1\">Matsushita nodded. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.2\">“Seems like it, yeah.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.1\">It seemed that something had happened, either on the 24th or the 25th, and ever since then the two of them had clearly been acting differently. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.2\">People speculated that they must have taken a step beyond what their relationship had been so far, crossing some line. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.3\">Although such rumors had been going around for some time, even during the school trip, it’d never been confirmed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.4\">But even so, the way Ike and Shinohara were acting now made their classmates realize that they were right.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.1\">Sudou had been friends with Ike for a long time, and last year, they had many, many animated conversations about how they would’ve liked to do </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.1\">this</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.1\"> or </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.1\">that</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.1\"> if they had girlfriends. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.2\">Sudou was frustrated that his friend had beaten him to it, getting a girlfriend before he did, and now he found himself exasperated seeing the two of them flirting all the time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.3\">His feelings burst out with a heavy sigh. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.4\">“Kanji, you…” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.1\">Onodera, sitting next to Sudou, who couldn’t understand his conflicted state of mind, spoke to him in a whisper, somewhat worried. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.2\">“What’s the matter, Sudou-kun?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.25.1\">“Nothin’. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.25.2\">Anyway, more importantly, I’m glad that the class is back to normal.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.1\">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.2\">Things were pretty rocky up until just a little while ago,” said Onodera.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.1\">After the Unanimous Special Exam, there were several people who’d been anxious about whether certain friendships would fall apart thanks to Kushida mercilessly exposing people’s secrets. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.2\">Wang had gotten support thanks to Matsushita and some other girls supporting her after her crush on Hirata had been made public knowledge. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.3\">And Shinohara, who had been made fun of about her physical appearance, had completely recovered thanks to the support of her boyfriend, Ike. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.4\">These people all coming together and meeting like this today was evidence of the fact that their relationships were gradually mending, little by little.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.1\">“Maezono, come onnnnn, get this show on the road already,” said Sudou, trying to hurry things along, unable to look at the hot and heavy couple playfully flirting with each other.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.1\">“Yeah, I suppose you’re right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.2\">Ahem. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.3\">First, thank you all for coming here today,” said Maezono.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.1\">Maezono began the meeting first by thanking all seven of the people she had approached for coming. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.2\">Maezono, when she first came to this school, had been quarrelsome, willing to snap at anyone and everyone, and had a foul mouth and a bad attitude. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.3\">Maturity had softened her, however, and she had mellowed out—at the very least, she didn’t appear to be disliked by any of the people currently present. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.4\">In fact, she was close to being best friends with Wang and Satou. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.5\">Maezono was ostensibly included in that category of good friends too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.6\">But inwardly, Matsushita didn’t think much of Maezono at all.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.1\">“I don’t mind gettin’ together or anything,” Sudou said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.2\">“But if we’re gonna be talkin’ about the future of the class, why is it just us here? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.3\">This is important, ain’t it?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.1\">He seemed to have the same question in mind that Matsushita had. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.2\">After hearing her concerns being expressed out loud, Matsushita hoped the conversation would continue along those lines.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.33.1\">“Yeah, now that you mention it, you’re right,” agreed Ike. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.33.2\">“Why?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.1\">He and Shinohara exchanged glances, as though they had just noticed this issue for the first time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.2\">Matsushita had a theory tucked in the corner of her mind that Maezono simply hadn’t thought about it, but…</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.1\">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.2\">To tell you the truth, there’s a proper reason for it… I deliberately chose not to invite Hirata-kun and the others,” Maezono said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.3\">“There’s something I wanted to make clear before the third semester starts.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.4\">She seemed to be giving what she was saying proper consideration. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.5\">With that established, she began to explain the purpose of this discussion. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.6\">“When I say that there’s something I want to clear up, I mean regarding Ayanokouji-kun.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.1\">So this was about a classmate? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.2\">The seven students Maezono had invited didn’t react strongly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.3\">They seemed puzzled why they needed to discuss him at all.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.1\">“I know it might be a problem for me to say this,” she said, “but, well, I don’t think I like Ayanokouji-kun. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.2\">Well, no, I guess that’s not quite right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.3\">To be perfectly honest, I’m not good at dealing with him.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.4\">Perhaps she had decided that her words had been a little harsh, because she softened the initial statement.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.1\">“‘Not good at dealing with him?’ </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.2\">Why’s that?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.3\">Wang asked, but she continued speaking before getting an answer. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.4\">“Ayanokouji-kun isn’t someone who causes problems, and he’s not pushy.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.5\">Wang couldn’t imagine anything about him that would give Maezono a bad impression of him.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.1\">“Well, no, he’s not,” admitted Maezono. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.2\">“But I guess it’s like, I don’t like suspicious, gloomy people, or like… If someone can’t get along with the group, it makes me feel like we’re not on the same wavelength, and I just get a weird feeling. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.3\">So, I guess that’s why I’ve been keeping my distance from him, I think?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.1\">Matsushita had remained silent until then, but now she asked pointedly, “So, you’re saying that your aversion to him is one-sided?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.1\">“Yeah… I guess that might be true, yes,” said Maezono.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.1\">“Well, I mean, sure, I guess if I had to say, Ayanokouji’s kind of a gloomy guy,” Ike agreed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.2\">“Y’know, like, the asocial type? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.3\">He’s always quiet.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.1\">The image Maezono had of him wasn’t exactly wrong, per se. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.2\">It wasn’t about liking or disliking him, merely the fact that Ayanokouji’s personality gave an impression of someone taciturn and a little gloomy.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.1\">“It’s different now, though. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.2\">At least, I think so.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.3\">Sudou was the first to dissent. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.4\">He provided evidence for his claims, too: “Besides, if he was that suspicious and gloomy in the first place, there ain’t no way he could wind up datin’ that Karuizawa. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.5\">Y’know?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.1\">“Yeah, the fact that he’s dating Karuizawa was a real surprise,” said Ike. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.2\">“But still, I mean, come on.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.3\">While he found part of what Sudou said convincing, the image that he had of Ayanokouji in his mind was largely unchanged. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.4\">Ike had judged what Sudou had said earlier to be more about sticking up for Ayanokouji than actually providing a sound argument, and he pressed Sudou on that point. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.5\">“Actually, you’ve been talkin’ to Ayanokouji a lot lately, Ken. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.6\">When did you guys get to be so chummy?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.46.1\">While Sudou was a bit taken aback by this, he picked up his cup containing his drink. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.46.2\">“Hey, it wasn’t just me and him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.46.3\">You were there too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.46.4\">We all hung out a bunch when we first started school.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.1\">“Well, sure, but it was, like, just hangin’ out with classmates. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.2\">We weren’t especially close or anything. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.3\">Did </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.48.1\">you</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.49.1\"> think we were close friends then?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.49.2\">countered Ike.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.50.1\">“W-well, I…” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.51.1\">Sudou had been throwing out counterarguments up until that point, but he choked on his words as he thought back to when they started school. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.51.2\">As Sudou and Ike started glaring at each other, though, Maezono hurriedly put a stop to it.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.1\">“Hey, hold on!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.2\">she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.3\">“No fighting! </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.4\">We haven’t even gotten to the main topic yet. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.5\">I’ve got a bunch of questions I want to ask you today, Sudou-kun, since you’re started to become closer friends with Ayanokouji-kun.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.1\">The standoff subsided as Ike and Sudou broke eye contact. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.2\">Sudou caught his breath before turning to Maezono. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.1\">“…Me?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.2\">he said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.1\">“Yeah, you. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.2\">I think that you’d know the most about what’s going on with Ayanokouji-kun lately out of any of us.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.3\">Maezono felt there was no point in dragging this out any further. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.4\">She lowered the volume of her voice a little, and started to get to the heart of the matter. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.5\">She started by saying to her friends, who still didn’t understand what this was about, “I don’t think that Ayanokouji-kun is just some gloomy classmate. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.6\">I think he’s hiding something.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.56.1\">With that said, everyone, including Ike and Shinohara, began to understand what Maezono wanted to say.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.1\">“So, does that mean that today’s meeting is about discussing who exactly Ayanokouji-kun is? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.2\">Is that right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.3\">asked Wang.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.58.1\">Maezono nodded several times in affirmation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.58.2\">“I excluded his girlfriend, Karuizawa-san, from this meeting, of course. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.58.3\">But also Satou-san, because she’s Karuizawa-san’s close friend, and also people who are often in contact with Ayanokouji-kun, like Hirata-kun and Horikita-san, as well as Hasebe-san and the others that he used to be in that group of friends with.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.59.1\">“But why?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.59.2\">asked Wang. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.59.3\">“I would’ve thought it’d be better to have as many people who know him well as possible, but…” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.60.1\">“I’m not so sure about that,” Maezono said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.60.2\">“Actually, I think they’d probably mislead us if we included them. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.60.3\">I think that all those people I just named probably know who Ayanokouji-kun really is. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.60.4\">Otherwise,” she muttered under her breath, “things don’t add up at all.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.60.5\">That was precisely why she had excluded students who had strong connections to Ayanokouji, based on what she could tell of the situation.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.1\">“Okay, but if that’s true, then why’d ya call me?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.2\">asked Sudou.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.62.1\">“Well, if nobody here knows anything about Ayanokouji-kun, then the discussion’s not gonna go very smoothly, is it? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.62.2\">I figured that you’d tell us things honestly, Sudou-kun.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.62.3\">Maezono responded with pride in her voice, as she had thought it out in her own way and selected people that could be trusted. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.62.4\">Someone with information would be vital if they were going to further explore the issue.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.63.1\">“Okay, I think I get what you’re saying,” said Shinohara, but she tilted her head to the side in confusion. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.63.2\">“But is this really something that warrants meeting in secret about?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.64.1\">“At present, yeah, it is,” Maezono replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.64.2\">“I mean, sure, it would be nice if there was nothing to talk about, or like, I think that would be best, but… I mean, it’s obvious that he’s strange, right? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.64.3\">Ayanokouji-kun, I mean.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.1\">The people present exchanged looks. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.2\">There was a period of silence for a short while, but then someone unexpectedly spoke up next, backing up Maezono’s opinion.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.1\">“…I certainly do find him a little mysterious, if I’m being perfectly honest,” Wang admitted reluctantly.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.1\">“I know, right? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.2\">Right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.3\">Maezono made no attempt to hide the delight in her facial expression at the appearance of a sympathizer to her cause. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.1\">“Mysterious? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.2\">What do you mean by that, exactly?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.3\">Shinohara asked, leaning forward slightly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.4\">She wasn’t sure exactly what Wang was referring to.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.69.1\">“I think there’s a gap between his OAA, what the school has assessed and disclosed, and his real abilities, at the very least,” Wang said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.69.2\">“I suspect that his OAA scores are actually lower than his real abilities, whether we’re talking about Academic Ability or Physical Ability.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.1\">“Come to think of it, what were Ayanokouji’s OAA scores again?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.2\">asked Ike.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.71.1\">Ike didn’t know offhand, so Shinohara, who was sitting next to him, brought out her phone and showed him.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.72.1\">“…Yeah, something’s weird,” he huffed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.72.2\">“I can’t accept that he’s just flat out better than me in every category.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.72.3\">Ike recalled he’d groaned upon seeing the scores in OAA.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.73.1\">“Well, it’s just that you’re no good, Kanji,” replied Shinohara.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.1\">“He has improved quite a bit, though, even from the time that OAA was first introduced,” said Wang. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.2\">“Perhaps he’s just working hard to improve, like Sudou-kun, but I don’t feel like we can see any trace of that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.3\">Wouldn’t you say so?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.75.1\">Sudou, who’d initially had the lowest possible score in Academic Ability, an E, had raised his score by studying day after day. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.75.2\">His improvement in his attitude and everyday behavior was clear to everyone in their class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.75.3\">On the other hand, though, in Ayanokouji’s case, no one had been able to see any sign of him putting in that kind of effort. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.75.4\">It wasn’t surprising that Wang would find it all so mysterious, wondering about the sudden, strong impression she got seeing him score high on a test and his incredible speed during a race.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.76.1\">“And the conclusion that we can draw from that is that he’s not giving things his best effort, right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.76.2\">added Maezono. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.76.3\">This was what she had been wanting to say since the start, the reason she had gathered her friends together.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.77.1\">“I think that’s reasonable,” said Wang.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.1\">“You mean he’s holding back?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.2\">asked Shinohara.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.1\">“Of course, right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.2\">Maezono replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.3\">“It means that he hasn’t been taking things seriously this whole time.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.80.1\">“But why would he do that?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.80.2\">asked Ike.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.81.1\">“Maybe it’s like, he hates working hard, or something like that?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.81.2\">Shinohara suggested.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.82.1\">“Wait a minute, hold on,” Matsushita cut into the tide of negativity. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.82.2\">“I understand what you’re trying to say, but that’s not necessarily always the case, right? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.82.3\">People don’t have to show their work outwardly, whether we’re talking about studying or athletics. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.82.4\">If Ayanokouji-kun doesn’t like to stand out by nature, it’s possible that he’s just putting in effort behind the scenes.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.83.1\">She felt it was possible that in contrast to Sudou, who had been working on himself out in the open, Ayanokouji had gained competency by working on himself behind the scenes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.83.2\">If he had been hiding his abilities from the very beginning, then his reputation would suffer. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.83.3\">Everyone would judge him for making no effort for the sake of the class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.83.4\">If the group was going to speculate without evidence, Matsushita didn’t want them to assume something negative.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.1\">“I sure didn’t have the best reputation when I started school here, for real,” Ike mused. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.2\">“Maybe he’s just trying desperately hard now to prove himself to everybody? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.3\">Heck, I’m working pretty hard on that myself right now, and I’ve been making progress.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.4\">He didn’t add a lot and simply seemed to agree with Matsushita.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.1\">“Do you really get what’s going on here, Ike-kun?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.2\">said Maezono, slightly angry.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.86.1\">“Wh-what the eff? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.86.2\">Why are you acting like I don’t get it?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.87.1\">“Because, in the special exam we had the other day, Ayanokouji-kun got five questions perfect,” she told him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.87.2\">“Didn’t you notice that?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.88.1\">“Well, sure, yeah, I noticed, I guess… But some other people got all their questions right too, didn’t they?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.88.2\">Ike said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.88.3\">Students who had an Academic Ability score of B or better, like Horikita and Hirata, had done perfectly.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.89.1\">“The problems that Ayanokouji-kun solved were even more difficult than the ones that Horikita-san and the others did,” Maezono argued. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.89.2\">“I also saw the results for students in other classes too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.89.3\">The questions he answered were so difficult that even some students with an A score in Academic Ability got them wrong.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.89.4\">She couldn’t imagine a small amount of effort would have been enough to explain that.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.90.1\">“But, hey, maybe it’s, y’know… Oh, if I remember right, he’s really good at math, right? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.90.2\">If they were math questions, then it makes sense. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.90.3\">Right?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.91.1\">“Only one of the problems we solved was a math question, though,” said Maezono. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.91.2\">She’d done her research before calling this meeting. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.91.3\">“The rest were two English problems, one chemistry problem, and one contemporary literature problem. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.91.4\">They weren’t all from just one subject.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.92.1\">“I think you might be on to something. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.92.2\">I was kind of wondering about that, too,” said Wang, nodding. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.92.3\">She was an excellent student herself. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.92.4\">“Taking that into account, I’m starting to think that the discrepancy between his OAA scores and his real abilities is actually even more immense than I thought.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.93.1\">“I know, right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.93.2\">said Maezono. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.93.3\">“I mean, right? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.93.4\">It is </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.94.1\">definitely</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.95.1\">bizarre, don’t you think?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.1\">Matsushita thought about interrupting Maezono’s judgmental ranting, given that she’d made up her mind and this wasn’t productive, but she held herself back. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.2\">It was obvious that it would be difficult for her to propose something like the idea that the questions Ayanokouji had gotten right had just so happened to be covered in the material that he’d studied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.3\">If Matsushita spoke up like that too often and too carelessly, it would make her appear as though she were simply rushing to Ayonokouji’s defense. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.4\">Matsushita didn’t necessarily disagree with what they were saying, but she wanted Ayanokouji to play a useful role in the class in the future. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.5\">She didn’t want to allow a buildup of aggression from other students to interfere with that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.6\">That was precisely why she had decided that she shouldn’t make a statement that would be clearly seen as a show of support for him at this time.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.97.1\">“Maybe he just took wild guesses and got them right, though?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.97.2\">offered Ike. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.97.3\">Ike wasn’t coming in as a defender of Ayanokouji or anything, but his rather spontaneous comment ended up saving Matsushita. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.97.4\">Ike’s ability to naturally speak up and say the things that Matsushita couldn’t on her behalf made her think that perhaps he was just the person she needed in this situation.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.98.1\">“No, it wasn’t </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.1\">guessing</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.1\">, and it wasn’t coincidence, either,” Maezono said firmly, with particular disdain for the word ‘guessing.’ </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.2\">“Ayanokouji-kun must have always been smart.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.1\">“Is there another reason for that?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.2\">asked Wang. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.3\">She seemed curious about the truth.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.1\">After taking a look around, Maezono lowered her voice once more. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.2\">“This is just something I heard, okay? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.3\">So…you remember how in the special exam on the uninhabited ­island this year, they had these tests and stuff over the island that you could get points or stuff from? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.4\">I heard that there was one that Ayanokouji-kun participated in, and he answered all the questions correctly without any trouble at all, even though they were supposed to be super hard.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.103.1\">The fact was that Ayanokouji had possessed a high level of academic prowess even before the special exam was held in December. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.103.2\">Though Maezono had prefaced her statement with a disclaimer that it was something she heard from someone else, she wanted the others to take the rumor seriously.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.1\">“I don’t know what the truth is, but… I think you’re right,” said Wang. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.2\">“The image I have of Ayanokouji-kun in my mind now hasn’t changed very much from the image I had of him when we started school here, but… It’s just, I kind of get the feeling that our circumstances have changed a lot. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.3\">Hirata-kun also seems to trust Ayanokouji-kun a great deal, too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.4\">They call each other by their first names. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.5\">I think that Ayanokouji-kun is probably the only person Hirata-kun is like that with.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.105.1\">Wang had feelings for Hirata; she paid more attention to him than anyone else did. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.105.2\">If she said something like that, then there was no doubt about it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.105.3\">They all listened attentively, not hesitating to trust what Wang said in the slightest. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.106.1\">“Horikita-san’s the one leading the class, but… Don’t you think that maybe Ayanokouji-kun’s been pulling the strings from behind the scenes, and more than just once or twice?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.106.2\">said Maezono.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.107.1\">In response to Maezono’s impassioned speech, others, starting with Onodera and then Ike and Shinohara, nodded their heads deeply in agreement. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.107.2\">Matsushita, listening to the discussion as it unfolded around her, had come to understand something once again: everyone in their class had already begun to realize the potential that Ayanokouji possessed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.107.3\">That was because, of course, Ayanokouji was taking more overt action than he had during their first year, but the problem was that there was a possibility people would interpret this negatively. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.107.4\">In that case, Matsushita decided, she should shift to a different position for the time being.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.108.1\">“I think that your read of the situation might be correct, Maezono-san,” she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.108.2\">“Ayanokouji-kun has a long history of getting mediocre results, so it should follow that even if he’s improving, he shouldn’t suddenly leap to the results he’s getting now. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.108.3\">And maybe if he had been serious about things from the very beginning, he could’ve had an A in Academic Ability, at the very least.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.1\">A look of triumph settled onto Mazeono’s face when she saw that Matsushita, who had been a skeptic before, came around to her side. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.2\">A woman’s intuition. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.3\">The look on Sudou’s face didn’t escape Maezono’s notice, and she pressed him on it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.4\">“Sudou-kun, do you know anything special about Ayanokouji-kun?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.5\">she asked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.6\">“Preferably something the rest of us don’t know, if possible?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.110.1\">Sudou looked hesitant, like he was of two minds. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.110.2\">Maezono was bursting with anticipation, waiting for more from him.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.111.1\">“What? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.111.2\">Is there something? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.111.3\">If there is something, tell us,” she said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.112.1\">At the start of their second year, Sudou had felt something when he saw what happened with Housen. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.112.2\">He had caught a glimpse of Ayanokouji’s strength. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.112.3\">Now, he wondered whether he should bring it up. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.112.4\">Although that series of events was a secret, so nobody should know about it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.112.5\">Sudou mulled it over internally, thinking,</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.113.1\">“</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.114.1\">I’m pretty sure they didn’t say anything about keeping quiet about Ayanokouji’s ability itself, though, right?”</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.115.1\">If it was something that they didn’t want anyone to get word of, then Sudou would have strongly reminded himself to keep quiet.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.116.1\">“…Yeah, okay,” he said at last. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.116.2\">“You and the others are only focusing on the academic side of things here, Maezono, but I think his amazing growth isn’t just in Academic Ability.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.1\">“Huh? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.2\">What do you mean?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.3\">asked Maezono.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.1\">“You guys saw it yourself, right? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.2\">How fast Ayanokouji was back in that relay race. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.3\">He was faster than me.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.1\">Although they hadn’t technically competed directly against each other at full strength, Sudou had to admit that he would lose to Ayanokouji, no contest required. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.2\">At this stage, few people were surprised by Sudou’s claims; it was already well known that Ayanokouji had competed against the previous student council president, Horikita Manabu, and that what they saw had been unusual. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.1\">“Well, yeah, of course,” said Maezono. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.2\">“Everyone knows that already. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.3\">Right?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.121.1\">Sudou revealed more of the truth. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.121.2\">“But it ain’t just that he’s quick. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.121.3\">It’s like, okay, it’s kinda frustrating for me to admit this, but he’s more athletic than I am in general.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.122.1\">“M-more than you, Sudou-kun?!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.122.2\">exclaimed Maezono, incredulous.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.123.1\">Sudou continued, choosing his words carefully, perhaps because he was thinking of how best to convey how amazing Ayanokouji was as straightforwardly as possible. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.123.2\">“If there’s anything that I could beat him at in a serious competition, basketball would pretty much be it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.123.3\">And even then, I wouldn’t wanna actually play against him, if possible. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.123.4\">It ain’t like I feel like I’d lose, but it’s like, I have a feeling he’d really drive me into a corner if we were gonna play. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.123.5\">It’s like, that’s what my gut tells me.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.124.1\">Ayanokouji had made Sudou, the person with the top-rated Physical Ability score in their entire grade level, raise the white flag. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.124.2\">That fact alone was incredibly stark.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.1\">“Okay, that’s incredible if true, but why do you think that?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.2\">Maezono was excited, but she pressed Sudou for more. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.1\">Since there was no way that Sudou could ever mention anything about that fight with Housen, he decided that he’d just need to make something up on the spot. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.2\">“I got into it with Ayanokouji before. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.3\">I picked a fight with him, totally uncalled for on my part. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.4\">I tried to punch him, but I couldn’t land a hit on him at all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.5\">It’s like, I could feel how incredible he was from that fight.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.127.1\">Sudo hid the lie behind a sip of water. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.127.2\">Even while coming up with that story, though, he thought back to the time Ayanokouji had fought Housen. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.127.3\">Ayanokouji was completely undaunted in the face of Housen, an opponent Sudou would have been helpless to defeat. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.127.4\">And on top of that, Ayanokouji didn’t seem afraid of being stabbed; he fought back so calmly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.127.5\">The truth was that Sudou had seen plenty, enough to make him realize that he wouldn’t be able to win against Ayanokouji if they ever fought. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.127.6\">Sudou’s words had the weight of real emotion, which made it seem truthful. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.127.7\">Maezono was convinced.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.128.1\">“Maybe Karuizawa-san started going out with Ayanokouji-kun because she realized that he had more to offer than Hirata-kun…? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.128.2\">If so, then damn, Karuizawa-san’s great at sniffing out talent.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.128.3\">Maezono made no attempt to mask her tone, sounding at once as if she was complimenting Karuizawa and disgusted with her.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.129.1\">“Yeah, I’ve been wonderin’ that too for a while,” Sudou said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.129.2\">“Why </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.130.1\">did</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.131.1\">Karuizawa start datin’ Ayanokouji?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.131.2\">That was something he didn’t understand, precisely because he had experienced how incredible Ayanokouji was. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.131.3\">“If Karuizawa found out about Ayanokouji, saw what he was like, then she would have chosen him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.131.4\">I could believe that, I guess.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.1\">But just then, another emotion was born within Sudou. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.2\">He felt that, if that were true, then there wouldn’t have been any reason for Ayanokouji to choose Karuizawa as his girlfriend. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.3\">Her physical appearance aside, Sudou felt that Karuizawa’s personality was unpleasant. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.4\">He knew that was a subjective opinion, though, so he decided to keep it to himself.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.1\">“I dunno, dude, I feel like from your point of view, that’s an insane level of praise, Ken,” Ike said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.2\">He definitely grasped what Sudou’s explanation meant, but he seemed uncertain. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.3\">“I still don’t really get it.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.134.1\">“Well, I mean, it’s only natural you’d feel that way,” Sudou replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.134.2\">“You won’t get it unless you experience it for yourself, I guess.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.1\">“Yeah, that’s true. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.2\">Okay then, so how do you think we can get a handle on how incredible he is?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.3\">asked Maezono, hoping that Sudou would give a little more to substantiate his claim.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.1\">“I dunno, I—wait. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.2\">I got it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.3\">What about, like, suddenly throwin’ a punch at him? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.4\">Come up from behind, like </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.1\">wham</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.138.1\">.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.1\">“No way, dude! </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.2\">From behind? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.3\">Forget it!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.4\">said Ike.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.140.1\">“Dude, there ain’t no way you’re gonna land a hit on Ayanokouji unless you sneak up on him,” said Sudou.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.141.1\">“Come on, man, I could totally hit him with a sneak attack,” Ike protested. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.141.2\">“But I wouldn’t do that because it’s not fair, in the first place.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.1\">“Okay then, why don’t you try him head-on, then?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.2\">Sudou crossed his arms. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.3\">“You’d have a zero percent chance in that case, dude. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.4\">Zero.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.1\">“Hey man, we don’t know that for sure, do we? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.2\">Y’know, I’m pretty confident in my fighting skills.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.3\">Ike stood up, alternating between throwing punches with his right and left fists. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.4\">He was making</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.144.1\">swish swish</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.145.1\"> sounds with his mouth, but his movements were sloppy.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.146.1\">“You’ve never actually been in a real fight before, though,” said Shinohara, exasperated, prompting Ike to sit back down. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.146.2\">He was being embarrassing.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.147.1\">“H-hey, shut up. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.147.2\">It’s just that I don’t bully weak people,” snapped Ike.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.148.1\">“Yes, yes, okay,” replied Shinohara.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.149.1\">“W-well, all right, let’s forget fighting,” said Ike. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.149.2\">“Anyway, if this is all true, then I’d like Ayanokouji to really get serious about stuff, like,</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.150.1\">bam</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.151.1\">. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.151.2\">If he did that, then the class’d be safe. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.151.3\">Or like, don’t you think that maybe we’d really manage to get up to Class A? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.151.4\">You think?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.152.1\">If they could ask Ayanokouji to contribute greatly with his academic and physical prowess, then that would be a significant asset for the class. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.1\">“That’s right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.2\">We’re in the same class, and I think it’d be all right to ask him to help,” said Wang. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.3\">If there were exceptional students in class, then they should definitely pull their weight.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.154.1\">“I agree. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.154.2\">Let’s ask him straight after winter vacation,” replied Shinohara, immediately agreeing with Wang’s suggestion. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.154.3\">It seemed perfectly reasonable.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.155.1\">Expectations of Ayanokouji were beginning to swell. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.155.2\">That was something that Matsushita had always hoped for, but at the same time, she was keenly aware that they needed to avoid making a big mistake.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.156.1\">“Wait, I have just one word of warning,” she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.156.2\">“I understand your desire to rely on Ayanokouji-kun, and how you feel reassured by this news, but I really think you should refrain from mentioning any of this in public and from trying to coerce him to do anything.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.157.1\">“Why though? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.157.2\">If we don’t say anything, then he’s not going to be constructive,” Shinohara grumbled. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.157.3\">Surely Ayanokouji wouldn’t be any help if he reverted to being the same kind of student he was before, the kind who always hung in the background.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.158.1\">“Yes, you might certainly be right about that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.158.2\">But I think we also need to consider why he’s been so meek up until this point,” replied Matsushita, gently reprimanding the students who were getting excited over the idea. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.158.3\">They should be considering Ayanokouji’s feelings.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.159.1\">Sudou had been hanging back and listening for a while, but this idea must have resonated with him, because he deliberately cleared his throat to get the group’s attention at that point. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.159.2\">“Yeah, she’s right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.159.3\">If he hates standin’ out that much, then spurrin’ him on unnecessarily might backfire on us.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.160.1\">“Yes,” said Matsushita. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.160.2\">“And if he becomes uncooperative as a result, that would be our loss, wouldn’t it? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.160.3\">We can tell that he has the desire to help us, like answering all those questions correctly on the last special exam.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.161.1\">Shinohara and the others seemed to understand what the two of them were saying about the danger of trying to forcibly drag Ayanokouji out onto center stage.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.162.1\">Onodera spoke up next. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.162.2\">“I agree. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.162.3\">If he were someone like Kouenji-kun, the type of person where you don’t know what they’ll do if you leave them be, that would be a different story. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.162.4\">But he’s not that type of person. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.162.5\">I think it’s okay to just continue treating him as we have until now for the time being.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.162.6\">She echoed the others, as if to provide a final reminder to the rest of the group.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.163.1\">At this gathering, at least eight people had come to a shared understanding. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.163.2\">Namely, that Ayanokouji was someone capable, far more so than his OAA scores indicated. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.163.3\">And even though they expected he would demonstrate his skills moving forward, they weren’t going to rush him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.163.4\">However, Maezono, the person who had arranged this meeting, had something completely different in mind.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.164.1\">“Is that really enough, though?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.164.2\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.165.1\">“Huh?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.165.2\">Onodera turned to look at her.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.166.1\">“I can totally understand that Ayanokouji-kun is an amazing student,” Maezono said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.166.2\">“But it’s exactly because of that that I’m scared, or like… I guess I find him creepy. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.166.3\">Because I mean…he nominated Sakura-san for expulsion, even though they were close, in that same friend group, remember? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.166.4\">Then there was the way Ayanokouji-kun pushed Kushida-san into a corner, he just totally steamrolled her… If Ayanokouji-kun felt like it, he could probably get </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.167.1\">anybody</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.168.1\">from class expelled.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.169.1\">The group had gotten absorbed in their conversation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.169.2\">It had already been over an hour since they got together, and during that time, more groups of students had come and gone, in and out of the café. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.169.3\">One student, who had already been at the café a few minutes before Wang—who was the first member of the group to show up to the café—had arrived, now got up from their seat. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.169.4\">They held an empty drink cup, which had been emptied some time ago.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.170.1\">“That was a decision that had to be made, though,” argued Sudou. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.170.2\">“’Cause of Kushida’s choice, remember? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.170.3\">Our class didn’t have any chance at winnin’ unless we expelled somebody. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.170.4\">It’s perfectly reasonable that he chose to expel someone based on OAA criteria, and didn’t bring any personal feelings into it.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.172.1\">“What?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.172.2\">he asked, flustered. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.172.3\">“Did I say somethin’ weird?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.173.1\">Maezono gave him a puzzled look. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.173.2\">“Maybe not </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.174.1\">weird</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.175.1\">, but it’s…” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.176.1\">Matsushita took over. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.176.2\">“She means that what you’re saying is really well thought out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.176.3\">I guess it’s like, you’re really growing as a person.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.177.1\">“Huh? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.177.2\">The hell is that supposed to mean?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.177.3\">barked Sudou.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.178.1\">“Well, if you were the old Sudou-kun, you wouldn’t say things like ‘personal feelings’ and ‘perfectly reasonable,’ would you?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.178.2\">said Matsushita.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.179.1\">“Yes, I think so, too,” added Wang.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.180.1\">“Hey, that’s totally normal! </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.180.2\">How stupid do you think I am?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.180.3\">replied Sudou.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.181.1\">“Isn’t that just a sign of how much you’ve matured?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.181.2\">said Onodera. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.181.3\">She had a happy look on her face for some reason, as though she were the one being complimented.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.182.1\">“Quit pokin’ fun at me.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.182.2\">Embarrassed, Sudou tried to force the discussion back on track. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.182.3\">“Uh, let’s see, where was I? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.182.4\">Oh yeah, that’s right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.182.5\">Ayanokouji ain’t really that bad a guy.” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.183.1\">“Yes, I know it was something that had to happen,” Maezono said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.183.2\">“I get that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.183.3\">That was an exam where someone had to be expelled, no way around it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.183.4\">But it’s like… How do I put this? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.183.5\">You remember that back-and-forth he had with Kushida-san leading up to it, right? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.183.6\">The way he was mercilessly driving her into a corner. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.183.7\">Totally indifferently… Yeah, like a machine, you know?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.184.1\">“It was a situation where he had to be ruthless,” protested Sudou, persistently defending Ayanokouji from the standpoint of someone who wanted to stick up for him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.184.2\">“It wasn’t like he wanted to do it.” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.185.1\">“So, if a similar situation were to come up, would you have Ayanokouji-kun make an emotionless decision again?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.185.2\">asked Maezono.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.186.1\">“It ain’t like we should rely solely on Ayanokouji or nothin’, but ain’t it necessary to make decisions objectively?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.186.2\">said Sudou.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.187.1\">“Objectively, huh? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.187.2\">You think that sounds good, everyone?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.187.3\">Maezono said pointedly, indirectly drawing attention over to Ike and Shinohara. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.187.4\">Their names could be found at the bottom of the ranks in OAA. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.187.5\">There was a hint of the future: Ayanokouji would probably choose one of those students as the next candidate for expulsion.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.188.1\">“W-well, w-w-wait a second here, hold on,” said Ike. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.188.2\">“Yeah, sure, I guess it’s, Ayanokouji’s way of doing stuff is kinda, y’know, out there, sure. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.188.3\">But having lots of friends is a respectable skill too, and I’d hope he’d take that into consideration, I mean. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.188.4\">Plus, if I were to get expelled, Satsuki would cry. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.188.5\">I mean, that wouldn’t be efficient at all or whatever.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.189.1\">“I absolutely do not want that to happen.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.189.2\">Shinohara, seated next to Ike, clung tightly to his arm and wasn’t letting go.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.190.1\">“And there’s also that whole thing about Hasebe-san ­really suffering for a long time because of what happened…” added Wang. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.190.2\">Bringing up that fact, which had occurred in the very recent past, made her face cloud over.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.191.1\">“If things stay as they are right now, then that’d be good,” Maezono said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.191.2\">“But…don’t you think we should absolutely avoid a potential future where Ayanokouji-kun becomes the class leader?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.192.1\">Maezono had finally got to what she was worried about. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.192.2\">The thing that she had felt anxious about, that she herself hadn’t been able to see exactly in her mind before, had now been put into words.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.193.1\">“There’s no way that Ayanokouji will become the leader, though. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.193.2\">He ain’t got the qualities for it,” argued Sudou.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.194.1\">“I’m not sure we can say that for certain, though,” said Wang. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.194.2\">“If he is skilled, then I think he could be.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.195.1\">“I think I’d welcome it, actually. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.195.2\">If Ayanokouji-kun really is capable, then I’d be fine with having him as the leader.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.195.3\">Matsushita, who prided herself on her brilliance, was in favor of Ayanokouji taking command of the class in the future. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.195.4\">While the lower-ranking students would need to fear the risk of being cut from class, the upper-ranking students, like her, would feel a sense of security in the knowledge that they would never be expelled while he was in charge as long as they were at the top of the class and didn’t do anything that would disrupt the leadership.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.196.1\">Horikita, who was currently the acting leader, was ­different. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.196.2\">Since Horikita’s judgment was somewhat influenced by emotion, Matsushita didn’t know whether she might get cut for some reason. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.196.3\">She felt that she couldn’t let her guard down.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.197.1\">“I am strongly opposed to that,” Maezono said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.197.2\">“I absolutely do not agree to having Ayanokouji-kun become the leader.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.198.1\">“Okay then, in that case, what exactly do you think should be done, Maezono-san?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.198.2\">Matsushita wanted to draw out the last of Maezono’s inexhaustible concerns.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.199.1\">“That’s—” Maezono hurriedly tried to reply, but perhaps she didn’t have a clear answer in mind, because she swallowed her words. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.199.2\">“Well, I guess it’s like, I don’t know the answer for sure, so that’s why we’re having this discussion. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.199.3\">You know?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.199.4\">Maezono choked it out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.199.5\">It sounded like she was running away from the question.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.200.1\">“Anyway, I don’t think we can get any answers even if we discuss Ayanokouji-kun’s way of thinking any further here,” Matsushita said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.200.2\">“No matter what anyone says, the class leader is Horikita-san. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.200.3\">If we dig into this discussion any deeper, we need to have her here with us. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.200.4\">Don’t you agree?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.200.5\">It was a harsh statement, but Matsushita said it in as soft a tone as possible.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.201.1\">It wasn’t as though she wanted to fight with Maezono. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.201.2\">And it wasn’t like she had wanted to make herself the center of the conversation, either. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.201.3\">What she needed to do now was impede them from taking an action that would elevate Ayanokouji’s position in class, by attracting their attention. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.201.4\">She could understand how the lower-ranked students like Ike felt, how they feared cold-hearted judgment, but that didn’t matter to Matsushita one bit. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.201.5\">In the back of her mind, Matsushita appended her statement with a</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.202.1\">“Look, I’m sorry, but…”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.203.1\">“You have a point, sure, but… Maybe if we discuss it more, we’ll find an answer?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.203.2\">replied Maezono.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.204.1\">Maezono wasn’t ready to stop yet, but the conversation didn’t go anywhere new. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.204.2\">Eventually, the topic of conversation shifted to the events of Christmas Eve.</span></span></p>\n<p

Masumi-chan,” It wasn’t the first time Hashimoto had told her that he appreciated her in that regard.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.221.1\">“So?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.221.2\">Kamuro scoffed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.221.3\">“That has nothing to do with ‘speaking your mind.’ </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.221.4\">And I hate how capricious you are.” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.222.1\">Hashimoto didn’t seem bothered by it, though, and tried to continue the conversation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.222.2\">“Come on, just hear me out for the time being. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.222.3\">Check out what I’ve been hearing.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.1\">He proceeded to tell Kamuro that he had eavesdropped on a certain group of people having a conversation at Keyaki Mall that day. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.2\">Hashimoto began to explain what he had heard, supplementing it with his own words based on facts that he had recorded with his phone. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.3\">He told Kamuro about a class discussion involving eight people including Sudou. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.4\">Despite her original lack of interest, by the time Hashimoto was finished, Kamuro’s expression had shifted.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.224.1\">“So? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.224.2\">Pretty interesting stuff, right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.224.3\">said Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.225.1\">“We already knew about it, though, to a certain extent,” said Kamuro.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.1\">“The core of Class B. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.2\">It’s not Horikita after all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.3\">That glimpse he showed us back on the uninhabited island, that strange feeling I’ve had about him, until now, that something was off—it all ties in to this. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.4\">And apparently, behind the scenes during the Unanimous Special Exam, something much more extreme than we even imagined happened. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.5\">It’s not easy to just drop a girl from your group of friends that you’ve been close with, is it? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.6\">He can be extremely ruthless. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.7\">And she wasn’t plain in the looks department either. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.8\">She was cute.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.227.1\">“What do her looks have to do with anything?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.227.2\">asked Kamuro.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.1\">“Of course it matters,” said Hashimoto. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.2\">“If Sakura was ugly, then people would think, ‘Oh, okay, whatever,’ even if they did have to cut her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.3\">Looks are a surprisingly big deal.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.1\">“You’re saying that Ayanokouji is someone who can make cold-blooded decisions based solely on the outcome, regardless of whether he’s close with the person or not.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.2\">While Kamuro didn’t agree with his opinion, she demonstrated that she understood the first part.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.1\">“That’s exactly what I’m saying,” he said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.2\">“On top of that, as you could tell if you’d heard that group’s discussion earlier, Ayanokouji isn’t especially high up in the class’s social structure by any means, at least not at the time of the Unanimous Special Exam. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.3\">It would be extremely difficult, a Herculean task, for a person like that to seize control of the class and lead them.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.231.1\">Hashimoto kept the recording on his phone saved securely, putting a lock on it so that he wouldn’t delete it by mistake.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.232.1\">“By the way, there’s something that’s been bugging me for a little while now,” said Kamuro.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.233.1\">“What’s that?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.233.2\">asked Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.234.1\">“How were you able to eavesdrop on such an important discussion?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.1\">“Simple coincidence. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.2\">Just got lucky is all.” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.236.1\">Hashimoto answered without hesitation, but Kamuro didn’t believe him in the slightest.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.237.1\">“Coincidence, huh,” she repeated.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.238.1\">The audio data that Hashimoto had recorded started from some point in the middle of the discussion that the students from Horikita’s class had been having when they met up in the café. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.238.2\">It would’ve appeared highly likely that they had only been engaging in meaningless chitchat. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.238.3\">There would have been no way for him to have foreseen any important discussion taking place there. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.238.4\">Even if Hashimoto were just out gathering intelligence at random, listening for anything he could get, how could there possibly be such a convenient coincidence as that?</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.239.1\">“Oh? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.239.2\">Do you perhaps doubt that it was a coincidence, by any chance?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.239.3\">he asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.1\">“Meh, not really. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.2\">If you don’t want to talk about it, I won’t ask. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.3\">It’s fine to just leave it as a coincidence, right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.4\">Kamuro judged that it was wiser not to pry too deeply and decided not to pry. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.5\">Hashimoto made no indication that he was going to answer her question, either. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.6\">“So, now what? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.7\">Sure, it was interesting info, but what’s next? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.8\">What’s the point of knowing?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.1\">“Before we arrive at any conclusions… If it’s confirmed that Ayanokouji is not a normal person, then I’m starting to wonder about what he’s been doing since coming to this school before today,” Hashimoto said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.2\">“Where he did it, and when. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.3\">Ryuuen was on a rampage right when we started school and then he suddenly went quiet. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.4\">Recently, we’ve even seen him interacting with Ayanokouji here and there, strangely enough. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.5\">Right?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.242.1\">Hashimoto told Kamuro about the assumptions and predictions that he had arrived at, while skillfully interspersing facts that they both already knew. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.243.1\">“So, you’re saying that…Ayanokouji is lurking in the background, behind Horikita…and Ryuuen fought him and lost?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.243.2\">asked Kamuro.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.244.1\">“Ryuuen isn’t the type to obsess over one simple win or loss,” said Hashimoto. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.244.2\">“If that was what happened, that he lost to Ayanokouji, then I think it was more than just losing. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.244.3\">I think however Ayanokouji defeated him, he demonstrated a considerable difference in strength between them, enough to make Ryuuen just give up.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.245.1\">“If that’s true, then why’s he getting involved with Ayanokouji after the fact? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.245.2\">Is he looking for a rematch?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.246.1\">“I’m sure he probably has that idea in mind too, yeah. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.246.2\">But I think it’s also likely that Ayanokouji’s personality’s got somethin’ to do with them getting all up in each other’s business, probably. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.246.3\">Y’know? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.246.4\">If Ryuuen assumes that he can get an advantage by getting involved with Ayanokouji, then he probably figures it’s better for Ayanokouji to see him as an ally than to see him as an enemy all the time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.246.5\">Don’tcha agree?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.247.1\">“So, he’s using him for his own purposes,” Kamuro mused. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.247.2\">“That’s what you mean. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.247.3\">Well, I guess that’s what we’d expect from Ryuuen, right?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.248.1\">Even if Ryuuen lost, it wasn’t like he’d simply go down. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.248.2\">Once he took a bite out of someone, he didn’t let go. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.248.3\">That way of doing things was exactly in line with what Kamuro imagined Ryuuen was like.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.249.1\">“There is definitely that, yeah,” said Hashimoto. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.249.2\">“But in this case, I think there’s more to it.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.250.1\">“More?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.251.1\">“Ryuuen is probably using Ayanokouji for his own benefit, yes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.251.2\">But I’ve got no doubt Ayanokouji knows it too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.251.3\">It’s like Ayanokouji’s practically tellin’ him, ‘Okay, if you want, I’ll let you use me, so try your best.’ </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.251.4\">Like that.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.252.1\">“What the hell is that all about?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.252.2\">Kamuro asked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.252.3\">“What does Ayanokouji gain from something like that? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.252.4\">I get that supporting Horikita from the shadows makes sense, in that he helps the class improve…”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.253.1\">“I’m not sure,” Hashimoto shrugged. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.253.2\">“Do you think he wants to crush Ichinose and Sakayanagi by helping Ryuuen, then, or something? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.253.3\">If Ayanokouji isn’t the type to get his own hands dirty, then relying on someone belligerent and aggressive like Ryuuen makes a heck of a lot of sense, doesn’t it?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.254.1\">“Yeah, you might be right about that.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.255.1\">“I’ve always had my suspicions before, but now, all that fog is finally startin’ to clear up. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.255.2\">The most troublesome enemy in Horikita’s class is Ayanokouji. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.255.3\">And…” Hashimoto hesitated for a moment before continuing. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.255.4\">“Ayanokouji is even more capable than the Princess.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.256.1\">“Are you certain?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.256.2\">asked Kamuro.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.257.1\">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.257.2\">I’m not going to tack on a ‘probably’ or ‘most likely’ by this point anymore. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.257.3\">That discussion today left me convinced.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.257.4\">Regardless of who the target of their analysis was, there was no way that Hashimoto would ever overestimate anyone to that degree.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.258.1\">“If what you’re saying is true, that’s trouble-trouble,” said Kamuro.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.259.1\">“Trouble, trouble, trouble. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.259.2\">It gets worse.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.259.3\">Hashimoto calmly declared what no one else in Class A would say. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.259.4\">“More importantly, we can expect that the final exam waiting for us at the end of the third semester is gonna result in a major point change. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.259.5\">If we do lose against Ryuuen then, we won’t be able to hold onto the winning position anymore.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.260.1\">Kamuro glared at Hashimoto, slightly annoyed by what he was saying. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.260.2\">From this point forward, a confrontation with Ayanokouji’s class couldn’t reliably be won. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.260.3\">Even if there was no imminent conflict, it was perfectly conceivable that it could come eventually. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.260.4\">Their first priority needed to be the final exam that was going to be held at the end of the third semester.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.261.1\">“You think that we’re going to lose to Ryuuen, don’t you?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.261.2\">she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.261.3\">“That’s why you’re worried about the future of Class A. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.261.4\">So, what, you’re hoping that we’ll lose? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.261.5\">That’s what you’d prefer?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.262.1\">“I don’t wanna lose, come on. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.262.2\">Wow, Masumi-chan, you really get mad over these kinds of comments.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.262.3\">Hashimoto was a little surprised—Kamuro was hardly one of Sakayanagi’s believers, after all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.262.4\">That wasn’t what made Kamuro angry, though.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.263.1\">“It’s just that I don’t like your pessimism is all,” she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.263.2\">“You always think like that.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.264.1\">“I’m not gonna deny that I take a pretty negative view,” he conceded. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.264.2\">“But there’s nothing wrong with bracing for the worst.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.264.3\">One never knew what kind of upsets or loopholes were in store at this school. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.264.4\">Hashimoto was always on the lookout for those, but he couldn’t anticipate everything.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.265.1\">But negativity was futile, in Kamuro’s opinion. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.265.2\">She didn’t want to hear it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.265.3\">“Bracing is okay. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.265.4\">But the least you could do is keep an open mind. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.265.5\">You can do at least that much, can’t you?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.266.1\">“Come on, don’t say that,” Hashimoto sighed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.266.2\">“You’re the only one I can talk to like this, Masumi-chan.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.267.1\">“Sigh…”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.268.1\">Even though Sakayanagi used Kamuro, Kamuro hadn’t offered up her heart to her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.268.2\">She complained if she didn’t like something Sakayanagi said, and she would even reject it without hesitation if she thought the situation called for it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.268.3\">That was what Sakayanagi liked about Kamuro, and the same went for Hashimoto, as well.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.269.1\">“But hey, keeping an open mind is good too, right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.269.2\">said Hashimoto with a smirk. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.269.3\">He was just joking, of course; that was just where the conversation had brought them. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.269.4\">“As long as we stay in the same class, that is.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.270.1\">That last remark, though, cast what could have sounded like pessimistic thinking in a new light.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.271.1\">“If you’re talking about Class Transfer Tickets, that would be a risky bet,” said Kamuro. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.271.2\">“I can’t imagine they’d give them out to losing classes, and even if they do give them out before the end of the year, there’s only a short window of time we’d have to use them.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.272.1\">While Class Transfer Tickets were powerful, the truth was that those tickets didn’t offer that much benefit. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.272.2\">The higher the class you were already in—and thus the more likely you were to earn them—the less benefit there was in moving to a lower class.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.273.1\">“Even if we do lose in this worst-case scenario that you’re anticipating, the classes will just be neck-and-neck at best,” she went on. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.273.2\">“Besides, if you were lucky enough to get a Class Transfer Ticket, would you be able to use it? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.273.3\">Even if we assume Ayanokouji’s abilities are the best in our grade, it would take a lot of faith to make the jump just for that.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.274.1\">Even if Ayanokouji’s class did temporarily move up to Class A, the more competitive the classes were, the more likely it was that their positions could switch again in a single special exam. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.274.2\">If Sakayanagi retaliated against Ayanokouji and her class rose to the top again, transferring classes would be a huge fiasco. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.274.3\">While it was possible that they could still be saved if they were lucky enough to be able to get another Class Transfer Ticket while in Ayanokouji’s class, that was just a series of wishful what-ifs.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.275.1\">“Those tickets would be useless to us, unless we were clearly in a downturn, like Ichinose’s class,” Kamuro concluded.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.276.1\">That was hardly something that Hashimoto and Kamuro were the first to contemplate. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.276.2\">It was a common topic of conversation among students, whenever they were chatting with each other, day or night.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.277.1\">“But those tickets aren’t the only method you can use to transfer classes,” Hashimoto pointed out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.277.2\">“Right?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.278.1\">“If you’re talking about the thing about twenty million points, then that’s impossible,” Kamuro said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.278.2\">“That’s even more unrealistic than a Class Transfer Ticket.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.279.1\">But Hashimoto was constantly keeping his eye on the possibility of transferring by cooperating with a class as a unit rather than as an individual. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.280.1\">“Look,” Kamuro continued, “I know this is probably none of my business, but what do you think’s going to happen if you try to profit while others fight?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.281.1\">She was being vague about what she meant, but Sakayanagi was aware of Hashimoto’s suspicious moves. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.281.2\">Kamuro herself had even reported them to Sakayanagi more than once now. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.281.3\">Kamuro figured it was unlikely that she was the only one on it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.281.4\">Sakayanagi probably had several students across all grade levels probing into Hashimoto’s business and keeping an eye on him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.281.5\">If Hashimoto showed any signs that he was going to betray the class and try to steal glory for himself, he’d be targeted.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.282.1\">“No matter who wins, all we need to do is be in Class A at the end,” Hashimoto said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.282.2\">“It sounds difficult, but it’s pretty simple.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.283.1\">“I understand what you’re trying to say. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.283.2\">But it’s better for you if you don’t get any weird ideas.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.283.3\">For now, Kamuro was Hashimoto’s classmate, at least in name. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.283.4\">As his classmate, she wanted to give him a bit of advice—a warning.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.284.1\">“Thanks,” said Hashimoto, albeit somewhat absently, in a small voice. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.285.1\">It wasn’t that he wanted to betray Sakayanagi. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.285.2\">It was just that in order for him to graduate from Class A, he couldn’t be totally committed to her, unyielding in following her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.285.3\">The powerful monolith that had existed when they first started school had crumbled, and now, there were three forces vying for the top spot. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.285.4\">No, in the back of his mind, he’d always considered the possibility of the top three duking it out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.285.5\">However, his initial assumption that Ichinose’s class would end up edging out the others had been a miscalculation.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.286.1\">He hadn’t noticed the true weight of Ayanokouji’s influence until after they’d passed the midpoint of their second year. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.286.2\">Hashimoto had conducted reconnaissance several times, and he hadn’t ever caught a glimpse of Ayanokouji emerging as a leader. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.286.3\">That was probably intentional, he figured. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.286.4\">However, Ayanokouji had been acting conspicuously again and again over the past few months—almost as though his previous mediocrity had been an act. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.287.1\">At first, Ayanokouji had been someone who laid low, and appeared uninterested in the class competition. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.287.2\">What was the reason for the about-face? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.287.3\">Had this been his strategy from the beginning? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.287.4\">Or had Ayanokouji just decided it was time to start pulling his weight, after dragging his feet all this time? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.287.5\">Questions kept fading in and out of Hashimoto’s mind, one after another. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.288.1\">Whether it was Sakayanagi, or Ryuuen, or Ichinose, Hashimoto had a clear picture of what they were all about—the kind of person they each were, and what kind of philosophies they had. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.288.2\">But when it came to Ayanokouji, Hashimoto couldn’t see an answer to any of those questions. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.288.3\">It was troubling.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.289.1\">“For the time being, I still want information,” Hashimoto said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.289.2\">“I plan to keep on digging into Ayanokouji and what’s going on around him.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.290.1\">“I don’t really care,” Kamuro replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.290.2\">“You can go ahead and do that on your own, can’t you?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.291.1\">Hashimoto had never been ordered by Sakayanagi to conduct any reconnaissance or gather information related to Ayanokouji, after all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.291.2\">As far as Kamuro was concerned, if he was so worried about it, then he should just do what he wanted on his own. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.291.3\">Truthfully, she could admit that the audio recording Hashimoto had gotten hold of today was going to be useful for the battle ahead… However, at the same time, Kamuro suddenly realized something. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.291.4\">As early as the beginning of last year, Sakayanagi had given her orders to investigate Ayanokouji. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.291.5\">Had Sakayanagi already noticed his abilities way back then?</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.292.1\">“Actually, Masumi-chan, that’s something I wanted to talk to you about,” Hashimoto said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.293.1\">Kamuro wondered, though, if Sakayanagi had really been able to understand everything that Ayanokouji was truly capable of at that time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.293.2\">One possibility emerged in her mind. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.293.3\">Could it be that Sakayanagi </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.294.1\">had</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.295.1\"> already known about Ayanokouji’s true abilities, but in a way that they didn’t expect…? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.295.2\">She wondered.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.296.1\">“Hey, Earth to Masumi-chan?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.296.2\">said Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.297.1\">Hashimoto waved his hand in front of Kamuro’s face as she stood there, lost in thought. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.297.2\">Coming to, she aggressively batted his hand away.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.298.1\">“…What?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.298.2\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.299.1\">“No, it’s just, you were spacing out there,” he said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.299.2\">“What I’ve got to say next is important.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.306.1\">“Even if I’m with you, you’re still there,” Kamuro pointed out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.306.2\">“That’s what together means, remember? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.306.3\">More importantly, even if I’m there

you, Kamuro-chan?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.313.2\">Hashimoto looked puzzled.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span

raised if they worked together wasn’t unfounded, but for Hashimoto, that was not an appealing proposition.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.316.1\">“I’ll find out what you want to know,” Kamuro insisted. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.316.2\">“Compromise.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.317.1\">Hashimoto figured that if he tried to push the issue, she wouldn’t show him any mercy; she’d just pretend the whole conversation never happened. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.317.2\">And she was refusing to let him call her Masumi for some reason, too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.317.3\">After spending close to two years together with Kamuro, though, Hashimoto had come to understand her well.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.318.1\">“Well… Guess I don’t got any other choice. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.318.2\">Okay. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.318.3\">Let’s shake on it.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.318.4\">Hashimoto extended his right hand. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.318.5\">But Kamuro didn’t take hold of it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.318.6\">All she did was shoot him an icy stare. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.318.7\">“Dang, frigid as ever,” he chuckled. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.318.8\">“I actually like you quite a bit, Kamuro-chan. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

back.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.320.1\">“Oh, so if I

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.322.1\">“Aww man,” replied Hashimoto, holding his hand to his forehead in a show of dismay. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.322.2\">The thinly-veiled smile on his face made it obvious it was a charade, and Kamuro just shook her head, done with putting up with this.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.323.1\">“I’m leaving now,” she told him.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.324.1\">“Sorry about that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.324.2\">Oh, but make sure you tell me what day you’re going to do this, and what time.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.325.1\">On that point alone, Hashimoto was insistent.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.326.1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Chapter_Header\"><span><span

day on which various students were following their own respective agendas, I, who had no way of knowing what those students were doing, ended up spending time with people that I didn’t usually see. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.331.2\">It was December 26. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.331.3\">Christmas had already passed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.331.4\">This day was also known as the day when stores sold the least amount of cake in a year. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.331.5\">Well, no, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it was famous for being the day when cakes were marked down.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.332.1\">There were theories as to why this was, but one of the reasons was that Christmas had passed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.332.2\">Japanese people quickly changed their mindset, shifting from focusing on Christmas to focusing on New Year’s, the next holiday. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.332.3\">Although it seemed like people had developed the custom of eating cake all year round nowadays rather than limiting themselves to specific events, the fact remained that this particular day was categorized as the day of the year when cakes didn’t sell. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.332.4\">Which was precisely why, in recent years, a not-insignificant amount of people intentionally bought cake on December 26 to take advantage of the markdowns.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.333.1\">None of that was really on my mind when I woke up early that morning, though—I figured I’d spend the entire day in my room. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.333.2\">The day that Kei would be recovering from her illness would soon be here. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.333.3\">Her fever had already subsided, and she was now able to move around a little bit. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.333.4\">If she wanted to repair the relationship, then we would go back to the way things were before.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.334.1\">My room was clean enough, but there was probably still dust in the corners and other hidden places, so today, I was going to thoroughly wipe everything down and clean the place up. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.334.2\">With the cleaning supplies I had prepared in advance laid out on the table, the battle was about to begin. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.334.3\">Thus began my struggle. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.334.4\">Starting that morning. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.334.5\">I moved the furniture, wiped everything down with a dust cloth, and thoroughly sterilized everything with alcohol disinfectants and such. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.334.6\">Of course, once I was finished cleaning my room, the next step was the toilet, and then the bath, and then the closet.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.335.1\">By the time the kitchen, my final stop, was cleaned to perfection, I noticed that the sun was setting outside. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.335.2\">Although it wasn’t snowing at this time of day, there still wasn’t any sign of the snow melting.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.336.1\">“I wonder if there’s any leftover Christmas cake,” I mused.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.337.1\">The 26th was almost over. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.337.2\">Many of the cakes that hadn’t been sold today were probably going to be thrown away. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.337.3\">Expiration dates and all that. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.338.1\">Should I go and look, to see if they’re selling them cheaply, just in case? </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.339.1\">I thought to myself. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.339.2\">I didn’t need a whole cake, but if they were selling slices of cake at a discount, I was interested in trying. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.339.3\">My mind made up, I decided to head to Keyaki Mall and enjoy the sunset.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.340.1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Chapter_Header\"><span><span

ARRIVED</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.345.1\"> that evening, Keyaki Mall looked different once again. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.345.2\">Since Christmas had already passed, the trees and decorations had already been removed, and preparations for New Year’s were underway, as expected. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.345.3\">There were no stores in the mall that specialized solely in cakes, so I went to the section of the supermarket where cakes were sold. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.345.4\">However…</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.346.1\">“None.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.347.1\">The usual cakes that they always had were up on display, but there weren’t any discounted cakes to be found. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.347.2\">The special section set up for Christmas was gone as well, and there wasn’t even a whole cake in sight. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.347.3\">Were the cakes sold out? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.347.4\">Had they just been tossed? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.347.5\">Maybe they just hadn’t wanted to pointlessly stock up too much, since the customer base they served was limited to who was here on campus. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.347.6\">It wasn’t like I had especially wanted it or anything, but now that I was here and found there was nothing, I felt a little disappointed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.347.7\">It was a wasted trip, but I didn’t want to make an unnecessary expenditure here. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.347.8\">I walked around the supermarket, taking two or three laps through the aisles to see if there was anything I needed, but in the end, I left the store empty-handed.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.349.1\">Just as I was about to leave Keyaki Mall though, I heard a voice calling to me, from off to the side. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.349.2\">It was Sakayanagi, sitting on a bench, waving at me.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.350.1\">“Are you already returning to your dorm room?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.354.1\">“I just happened to see you when you left

id=\"kobo.355.1\">I understood. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.355.2\">In that case, it was probably understandable that she’d promptly call out to me like that, considering there was no indication that I had purchased anything. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.355.3\">Kei was bedridden due to influenza, and I had spent Christmas doing nothing. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.355.4\">I explained to her that I had come to the supermarket because I had thought I might’ve been able to eat some cake at a discount.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.356.1\">“Ah, I see,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.357.1\">“I guess I just missed the time window,” I said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.357.2\">“It feels like at this rate, the opportunity’s just going to slip through my fingers.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.357.3\">I supposed that it likely wasn’t going to happen this year, considering I hadn’t eaten cake even on the 25th, let alone the 24th. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.357.4\">“It’s too bad that I missed out this year, but I’ll have some next year.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.358.1\">Sakayanagi chuckled elegantly from her spot on the bench. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.358.2\">“Ha ha.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.359.1\">“What’s so funny?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.359.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.360.1\">“No one has any guarantee that they will be able to eat cake at this school next year,” she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.360.2\">“Am I wrong?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.361.1\">“…No, you’re certainly not wrong.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.362.1\">“Especially so in your case, Ayanokouji-kun. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.362.2\">Once you return to your family home, you’ll have a life devoid of cake.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.363.1\">“I won’t even be served cake on my birthday,” I agreed.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.364.1\">Should I turn on my heel right now and head back to the supermarket?</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.365.1\">I wondered.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.366.1\">Sakayanagi, who couldn’t see that superficial thought running through my mind, stood up with her cane. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.366.2\">“By the way, I do not recommend the cakes from the supermarket.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.367.1\">“Really?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.368.1\">“I’m sorry to say this, but they’re the mass-produced sort you can find anywhere,” she said dismissively. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.368.2\">“Cakes should be produced by artisans.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.369.1\">“Sure, but there are only so many places where you can buy cake,” I said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.370.1\">“The convenience store has surprisingly good cakes available.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.371.1\">I see. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.371.2\">The Mont Blanc that Sakayanagi brought me before had come from the convenience store, if I remembered correctly.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.372.1\">“I suppose if you want a satisfying flavor, though, you have no other choice but to special order,” she added.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.373.1\">She started to walk away, but then she stopped just as she was passing by me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.373.2\">“I wonder if you would perhaps like to join me for a short while. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.373.3\">What do you say?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.374.1\">“Where?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.374.2\">I asked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.374.3\">“We’ll stand out too much if I’m out walking all alone with the leader of Class A.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.375.1\">“Please rest assured. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.375.2\">We will not remain alone for much longer.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.376.1\">As she said that, Sakayanagi gently raised her hand in a direction away from us. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.376.2\">When she did so, a male student spotted her and briskly drew closer to us.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.377.1\">“My apologies, Sakayanagi-san,” he said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.377.2\">“Were you waiting long?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.378.1\">“You certainly are a little late. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.378.2\">However, I was able to pass the time in an enjoyable fashion thanks to your tardiness, so I suppose it was a good thing.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.379.1\">I figured she meant chatting with me.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.380.1\">“Sanada-kun, have you ever spoken with Ayanokouji-kun?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.380.2\">asked Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.381.1\">“No, truthfully, today marks the first time we’ve ever talked,” Sanada replied, bowing politely to me. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.382.1\">I’d seen him around many times, as someone in my same grade. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.382.2\">I hadn’t ever had the opportunity to talk with him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.382.3\">His name was Sanada Kousei. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.382.4\">His OAA scores were as follows:</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.383.1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span

B</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.389.1\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.390.1\">He was an extremely bright individual with an A in Academic Ability, a score that only a few second-year students had achieved. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.390.2\">He was average in Physical Ability and above average in other areas, and he had no obvious weaknesses. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.390.3\">Although Sanada was an exceptional student, I had never seen him with Sakayanagi before now. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.390.4\">Though I had been encountering students from Class A more often lately, I was reminded now of how little interaction I’d actually had with Sakayanagi’s classmates. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.390.5\">At the very least, it didn’t seem like these two were here by chance.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.391.1\">“Actually, I’ve been wanting to talk with you sometime, Ayanokouji-kun,” said Sanada. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.391.2\">His tone of voice was polite, and his demeanor gentle. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.391.3\">I didn’t feel bothered by another man wanting to talk to me.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.392.1\">“Really?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.392.2\">I asked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.392.3\">I didn’t think I had done anything that would’ve drawn Sanada’s attention. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.393.1\">“Oh my, I see. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.393.2\">What about Ayanokouji-kun happened to catch your eye?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.393.3\">Sakayanagi asked him.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.394.1\">“Well, he’s emerged as one of the prominent students among Class B lately, and also…” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.395.1\">Sanada approached me, still smiling. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.395.2\">He gently took hold of my right arm and pulled me away from Sakayanagi, who I had been standing next to, putting distance between us.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.396.1\">“Please pardon my rudeness,” he said, “but what is the nature of your relationship with Sakayanagi-san?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.397.1\">“The nature of our relationship? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.397.2\">We don’t really have one,” I replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.398.1\">“She is the leader of Class 2-A. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.398.2\">She is not someone you can approach for no reason.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.399.1\">I wondered if Sanada had this strong perception of me as an enemy. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.399.2\">From the depths of his polite, courteous words, a sense of unidentified anger—or perhaps a chilly caution—oozed out.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.400.1\">“The fact she would be so familiar with a member of the opposite sex, one-on-one, is incomprehensible to me,” he said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.401.1\">That was an interesting way to put it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.401.2\">I wanted to say that it wasn’t like that, but that would’ve been difficult. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.401.3\">I got the impression that Sakayanagi didn’t do very much on her own—that a high percentage of her activities were, in fact, done with multiple people present. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.401.4\">Cases where Sakayanagi was alone with someone, and someone of the opposite sex on top of that, were carefully limited. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.401.5\">Even if it were a common sight for students in the same class, it wasn’t something that students from other classes would do often. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.402.1\">But I supposed it wasn’t a good idea to think too deeply about it right here. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.402.2\">I was just going ahead and picking apart Sanada’s phrasing and word choices on my own; how much of what he was saying was actually on his own behalf was hard to say. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.402.3\">Actually, if he was someone who would say these things for his own sense of propriety, then it’d be simpler for me to just play the role of a quiet, unsociable blockhead who wasn’t aware of anything.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.403.1\">“I had the opportunity to talk to her last year during final exams,” I told him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.403.2\">“That’s the extent of our relationship. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.403.3\">Nothing more, nothing less.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.403.4\">I decided to evade the question with a safe response. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.403.5\">Whatever the intention behind his question, that was the better choice.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.404.1\">“I see,” Sanada said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.404.2\">“I understand. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.404.3\">Please forgive me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.404.4\">I asked you that question in a somewhat intimidating manner.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.405.1\">“Don’t worry about it,” I answered.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.406.1\">“Have you two young men finished jawing?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.406.2\">asked Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.407.1\">“Yes,” Sanada replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.407.2\">“Ayanokouji-kun, would you mind accompanying us for a little while, if it’s not too much trouble? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.407.3\">If Sakayanagi-san permits it, of course.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.408.1\">“Hm?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.408.2\">I said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.409.1\">“Oh my, what an unexpected coincidence this is, Sanada-kun. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.409.2\">I actually just invited him myself,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.410.1\">Although I wasn’t sure what was going on here, Sakayanagi and Sanada seemed to have the same idea. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.410.2\">They exchanged glances and laughed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.410.3\">I followed their lead and quickly walked back from the exit, entering the mall once again.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.411.1\">“Here we are.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.412.1\">Shortly afterward, we arrived at the general store. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.412.2\">It was a popular store selling a variety of small items that were especially popular with the girls. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.412.3\">Both Class A students strode inside and started looking for whatever it was they were going to buy.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.413.1\">“Ayanokouji-kun, please give us just a moment. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.413.2\">If you don’t mind, please go ahead and look around the store at your leisure,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.414.1\">Even though I was told to go ahead and look, having not been given a detailed explanation about what was going on, I could do nothing but stand by and watch. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.414.2\">The background music playing throughout the store made it difficult for me to pick up on their hushed conversation, but I had no choice but to keep my distance from them, since I couldn’t join in. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.414.3\">I looked around the store to kill some time, but five or ten minutes later their conversation was still going strong, and there wasn’t any sign of their shopping trip coming to an end.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.415.1\">I was made to wait a pretty long time, and eventually I ran out of things to browse. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.415.2\">Eventually I approached Sakayanagi and Sanada to see what was going on. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.415.3\">As I did, Sanada hurriedly reached into his pocket.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.416.1\">“Please excuse me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.416.2\">I’m afraid I must take this call,” he announced.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.417.1\">After excusing himself politely, he walked out of the store and stood outside.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.418.1\">“I was out on a date with Sanada-kun today,” Sakayanagi told me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.418.2\">“I spent Christmas with him.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.419.1\">“I see. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.419.2\">That’s news to me.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.420.1\">I’d thought there was sort of a date-like vibe going on, but that was certainly a surprising revelation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.420.2\">Until now, I’d had no idea Sakayanagi had a partner like him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.420.3\">Was there some event that had spurred a major relationship change right before Christmas? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.420.4\">Or had they been together for a while and just never disclosed it?</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.421.1\">“Is that okay, though?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.421.2\">I asked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.421.3\">“Doing things so openly like this, I mean. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.421.4\">If it becomes known that someone is important to you, it wouldn’t be surprising if someone tried to use that against you.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.422.1\">Protecting a third party was a significantly different matter from simply keeping yourself safe. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.422.2\">Especially in Sakayanagi’s case, since having a limited range of mobility meant that the chances of her falling one step behind were not small.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.423.1\">“Of course,” I added, “I guess that’s just how confident you are in yourself, and… What’s the matter?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.424.1\">Sakayanagi was staring at me in silence. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.424.2\">But it wasn’t any normal silence. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.424.3\">She seemed angry.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.425.1\">“Couldn’t you tell that was just a little joke?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.425.2\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.426.1\">“What was?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.427.1\">“Come now. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.427.2\">Of course I didn’t agree to a date with Sanada-kun.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.428.1\">“Hm?” </span></span></p>\n</div></div>",
