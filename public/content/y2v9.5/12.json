class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.1\"> the first day of winter vacation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.2\">When I woke up that morning, I felt a little strange.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.1\">“…I had a weird dream,” I muttered, as I slowly propped myself up in bed by my elbow.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.1\">I had been sweating in my sleep, though only a little. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.2\">Normally, I didn’t really recall what I’d dreamed about when I woke up. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.3\">Whether they were good dreams or bad dreams, dreams were just that: dreams. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.4\">They melted away no matter how real they felt at the time, and that was kind of true for everyone. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.5\">That was the kind of creature humans were. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.6\">I wouldn’t be surprised if there were exceptions to that out there in the world, but when it came to this, I was typical. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.7\">Even if I remembered something about them right after I woke up, the memory would slip away in an instant.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.1\">“…Was, like, the homeroom instructor a bunny girl…?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.1\">Even as I tried to resist remembering it, it was futile to fight it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.2\">I’m sure that if a third party had heard what I just said, they probably would’ve cocked their head in confusion. </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.1\">What was that about rabbits?</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.1\">Anyway, I figured that any further attempt to dig deeper into what the dream was about would be a wasted effort.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.1\">I let the dream go. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.2\">Since we didn’t have class today, I took my time getting ready in the morning, letting the time crawl slowly by. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.3\">There were matching toothbrushes and cups in assorted colors lined up on the washbasin. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.4\">Even with the distance right now between me and Kei, who I’d been dating for quite a long time, life was getting back to normal. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.5\">It didn’t mean anything had changed between us. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.6\">There was something of a cold war between us lately, as lovers, one that had been brought about due to a disagreement.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.1\">There hadn’t been any emotional change on my part whatsoever as a result of this event. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.2\">Of course, I’d instigated it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.3\">But I had wondered, if this had happened unexpectedly—if I hadn’t caused it myself—would I have been able to really grab hold of this uneasy feeling I’d been reaching for?</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.1\">“…I wonder.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.1\">Ultimately, emotional changes were rooted in how indispensable the other party was to you. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.2\">Without that, why feel anything? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.3\">Hypothetically, if there was a situation where one’s life were in jeopardy, there wouldn’t be any need to hesitate to even hurt or abandon a lover if necessary, without a second’s thought. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.4\">Naturally, the reverse was also true. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.5\">The other party was entitled to do the same. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.6\">However, I believed that I had a duty as a significant other, separate from emotion. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.7\">If people were sharing their time together, if that time was made uncomfortable, it was their joint responsibility.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.1\">Furthermore, since this was the most precious time of our lives, we should strive to make it happy, rather than unhappy. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.2\">Of course, this was an idea based on the morality of human society, or similar. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.3\">It wasn’t a good idea for me to keep subjecting people to my experiments forever, continuing to burden them with mental and emotional anxiety and stress. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.4\">However, I hadn’t set this cold war in motion lightly—I had an idea in mind.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.1\">The plan had been for us to go shopping for a Christmas present, which we had promised to do before our relationship had deteriorated. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.2\">It was a standing appointment, as it hadn’t been explicitly crossed out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.3\">Originally, the date we’d planned for today was supposed to start this morning. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.4\">Apparently, it was raining outside, the poor weather continuing from before winter vacation started. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.5\">It was a little unfortunate, but we couldn’t expect clear skies for Christmas tomorrow, either, as the forecast was already calling for rain for the entire day.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.1\">It wasn’t like I had any control over the weather, of course, so there wasn’t anything I could have done about it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.2\">There was something else aside from that, though; something I hadn’t planned. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.3\">I cast a glance at the desktop calendar in my room. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.4\">A December calendar. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.5\">There were heart symbols drawn in pink pen, encircling the dates of the 24th and the 25th, but… Something had happened last night, the day our second semester ended. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.6\">I had tried to contact Kei directly so that we could meet on the 24th, but I couldn’t get through. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.7\">I waited for a while, then tried sending her a message and waited for her response. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.8\">But it had remained unread.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.1\">After spending close to an hour wondering what to do, I finally got a call back. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.2\">The first word that I heard come from Kei, after she first let out a cough that sounded somehow both weak and violent, was “influenza.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.3\">Seasonal influenza, or the flu, was very prevalent and could infect people of all ages, causing uncomfortable symptoms. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.4\">Since the number of infections typically began to increase significantly from late November into December, it wasn’t particularly unusual for people to catch it at this time of year. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.5\">It seemed that Kei had been unlucky enough to catch it herself and suddenly found herself bedridden. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.1\">Even though Kei was in poor health, she probably would have wanted to keep our promise of meeting on the 24th even if she had to crawl on all fours. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.2\">However, influenza spread via droplets that were sprayed and scattered around. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.3\">If she forced herself to go to Keyaki Mall, other people would be infected because of her selfishness. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.4\">Apparently, Kei had already started to feel like something was off shortly before she had gotten diagnosed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.5\">The first thing she did on the phone with me was apologize for not maintaining her health.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.1\">Obviously, there was no way I could have blamed her for catching the flu, so I told her right away that her priority was to rest and focus on getting back to good health. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.2\">I had also told her that our plans still stood and that we would plan to meet on a different day. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.3\">If Kei had replied, “Actually, I’d like to cancel our plans after all,” before we met up, it could still fall apart, but that wasn’t likely to happen at this moment. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.4\">If there was some change of heart on Kei’s part, it would be the influence of the wisdom of a third party. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.5\">However, since Kei was intensely dependent on me, she wasn’t likely to listen to anyone else. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.6\">If there was some hope of repairing our relationship, it was unlikely that she’d abandon that option. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.7\">She’d cling as though her life depended on it.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.1\">It was unclear how soon her flu would pass, but at any rate, at that stage of our conversation, we decided to wrap things up quickly, turning our thoughts toward the year’s end. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.2\">While it was easy to surmise that there were many things that she had wanted reassurance about, like our relationship, the current situation, and so on, Kei had a high fever right now and was too sick to carry on a proper conversation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.3\">So, I told her to focus on rest first, and brought our brief call to a close.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.1\">When I looked into the details afterward, I found out that Kei wasn’t struggling with basic needs, because her friends were bringing her supplies while she was laid up in bed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.2\">From the sounds of it, arrangements had already been made so that everything would be handled, even if there was some emergency in the middle of the night. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.3\">That was helpful, since I would have had curfew to deal with. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.4\">Best I not be involved.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.25.1\">And so…that was what had happened last night, on the 23rd.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.1\">That morning, I had also learned that several more students across all grade levels had contracted influenza too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.2\">The silver lining for the second-year students, despite this misfortune, was that we had managed to get through this special exam unscathed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.3\">I was sure that some of them might have been struggling with poor health during the exam and hid it from everyone. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.4\">For my own part, since I hadn’t had any close contact with Kei over the past few days, I personally wasn’t feeling any changes in my physical condition as of yet.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.1\">The problem now was how I was going to spend my day today. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.2\">My plans for both today, Christmas Eve, and tomorrow, Christmas Day, had all been called off. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.3\">Just then, though, I received a message from Ichinose on my phone.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.1\">“Good morning, Ayanokouji-kun. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.2\">I’ve heard that Karuizawa-san caught the flu. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.3\">Is she all right?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.1\">Another message followed afterward.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.1\">“It seems like other people aren’t feeling well, either. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.2\">Are you doing okay, Ayanokouji-kun?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.1\">I expected no less from Ichinose; she had an extensive information network. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.2\">She’d heard the news rather quickly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.3\">Apparently, she already had a good grasp on the situation, even Kei’s physical condition.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.1\">“Unfortunately, I think she’s going to be stuck in bed for a while,”</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.33.1\">I replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.1\">“I see…</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.1\">That’s worrisome. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.2\">If you ever need any help with anything, just let me know, anytime.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.1\">“</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.1\">Thanks</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.1\">.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.1\">Ichinose and I exchanged several more texts, and she asked me what I was thinking of doing today. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.2\">I had originally intended to keep the day open for Kei, but… Since I had to swing by Keyaki Mall to pick up a certain something regardless, my plan to go out had remained unchanged. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.1\">“I think I’ll go to the gym or something.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.1\">I assumed I’d end up going there anyway. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.2\">Besides, I didn’t really feel like meeting with anyone.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.1\">“Oh, okay. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.2\">Hey, what time do you think you’ll go?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.1\">“I don’t have anything to do, so probably before noon.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.1\">“All right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.2\">Actually, I was thinking of going to the gym around noon myself, but maybe it’d be better if I didn’t?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span

it was like we’re having a rendezvous, maybe? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.46.2\">Of course, it would just be a simple coincidence, but still.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.1\">We had both thought about going to the gym, and it just so happened that the timeframe that we planned to go during overlapped. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.2\">There wasn’t any point in worrying about a little detail like that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.3\">Ichinose was probably offering out of consideration for my girlfriend Kei, but it was unnecessary trouble on her part. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.4\">If anything, I found the idea of her scheduling things around me and my situation to be troublesome.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.48.1\">“You don’t have to worry about it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.48.2\">I’m just going to go to the gym as planned. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.49.1\">The moment I hit “send” on that last text, I saw that my message was read. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.49.2\">She responded with a sticker of some character (who I didn’t recognize) that looked like it was rocking back and forth,

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.50.2\">It was just after nine o’clock right now. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.1\"> before noon, the Christmas Eve spirit was everywhere you looked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.2\">The mall was decorated with even more magnificent ornamentation than the day before. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.3\">It even seemed like the ratio of the clientele coming to the mall to hang out today was a higher percentage of men and women together as couples. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.4\">I’d popped in at the gym a little while ago, just as I had told Ichinose I would. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.5\">It had only been a short time since I signed up, but I was paying a monthly fee, so I wanted to go as often as I could.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

thought. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.2\">As I contemplated this, I finished checking in at the reception desk. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.3\">When I changed into my workout clothes and stepped into the weight room, though, I saw that it wasn’t deserted after all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.4\">There were a few guys and girls my age here and there, and some adults, too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.5\">One person in particular caught my attention, who was about to start on the bench press. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.6\">It was none other than Mashima-sensei, the homeroom teacher for Class 2-A. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.7\">He had a large, muscular build, and his workout clothes suited him especially well.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.58.1\">“Good morning, Mashima-sensei,” I called out to him politely just as he was about to lay down flat.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.59.1\">“Hm? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.59.2\">Ayanokouji?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.59.3\">he responded with a little surprise in his voice. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.59.4\">“You’re a gym-goer too?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.60.1\">“I just signed up a little while ago.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.1\">“I see, I see! </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.2\">Very good, indeed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.3\">Welcome news.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.4\">For some reason, Mashima-sensei nodded with approval when he said that, as though his own child had passed the university entrance exam or something. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.5\">A little much for a student obtaining a gym membership. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.6\">“But what’s the impetus for you signing up?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.7\">he asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.62.1\">“I’ve felt like my level of strength and endurance has gone down compared to where it was before, so I thought I’d try to work back up to where I was.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.63.1\">“That’s a bit of an unusual reason for a student.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.64.1\">“I have to admit that I don’t know how long I’m going to stick with it.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.1\">“That’s all right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.2\">You know, I was giving it a little thought myself, and I decided to start working out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.3\">And now, I’ve really become quite the regular. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.4\">Working up a sweat in the same environment as the students isn’t bad, either.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.5\">Perhaps it was because he was more excited and livelier than usual, but Mashima-sensei spoke with a very welcoming, happy tone. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.6\">“I also have to commend you for coming to the gym on the first day of your winter vacation too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.7\">That’s dedication!”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.1\">“Do you have any plans for Christmas Eve today, sensei?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.1\">“Hm? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.2\">No, unfortunately, I’m just planning to sweat it out here in the gym all day,” he answered. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.3\">It sounded all very straightforward until he appended a furtive, quiet, “Probably.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.1\">Probably</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.69.1\">.</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.1\">He’d muttered it so quietly he only intended it for himself. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.2\">So why say it? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.3\">I wondered.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.71.1\">“Is something the matter?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.71.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.72.1\">“Oh, no, nothing. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.72.2\">Anyway, I’m guessing you’re probably completely lost in here, since you’ve only just started coming to the gym, right?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.73.1\">“Yes, I suppose you’re right.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.1\">I’m sure I would have no problem whatsoever with using and handling the equipment, but I decided to refrain from sounding too certain. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.2\">It would probably be easier for me to have him operate on the assumption that I was a newcomer and that I didn’t know anything. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.3\">At any rate, I figured it was probably about time I got started on something, and— </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.75.1\">“All right,” Mashima-sensei said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.76.1\">“‘All right’?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.76.2\">I repeated.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.77.1\">“This is a perfect opportunity. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.77.2\">You should take a minute to see what my workout is like.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.1\">“Huh? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.2\">Oh, sure…” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.1\">I’d been thinking about starting something myself, but Mashima-sensei ended up stopping me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.2\">Mashima-sensei lay down flat on the bench and began to adjust the bar, moving it into position so that it lined up with his eyes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.3\">He easily lifted the bar up several times without any ­effort, and after he had finished making adjustments, he raised the safety bars on both sides, holding them above his chest.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.80.1\">“Whenever you bench press, make absolutely sure you don’t forget about the safety bars,” he told me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.80.2\">“In the unlikely scenario of a collapse, these safety bars will support you.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.81.1\">“I appreciate the lesson.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.81.2\">I couldn’t say that I already knew that, so all I could do was continue to watch. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.81.3\">However, since it felt like it would’ve worsened the vibe if I didn’t say anything, I decided to ask him an ordinary-sounding question: “How many kilograms can you lift, sensei?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.82.1\">“Hm, let me think… I’m going with eighty kilos today, but I think I could probably go up to a hundred. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.82.2\">They say that only one in a hundred people can lift a hundred kilos, you know.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.83.1\">Though he didn’t have a smug look on his face, his tone was overflowing with self-confidence. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.83.2\">He flexed, as though deliberately showing me that he was physically fit. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.83.3\">I hadn’t seen anyone do that in person before—I’d always wondered if it was just something people did in movies.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.1\">“But if you push yourself too hard, your body will break,” he added. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.2\">“It’s not something like a workout plan on TV, where you see people lift the bar once and stop for the day. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.3\">You must repeat several sets, over and over, to strengthen your pectoral muscles.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.1\">Maybe he studied what to do by eagerly, desperately following what was on TV. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.2\">Sounded like it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.3\">After giving me that advice, he began to demonstrate. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.4\">As I watched this man take deep breaths, sweat pouring off him, I started to question the point of all of this. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.5\">I had gone through the trouble of coming all the way to the gym early in the morning, and yet the next thing I knew, I was watching some kind of P.E. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.6\">demonstration course. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.7\">I watched him go at it for a while; after he had completed three sets, Mashima-sensei sat up.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.86.1\">“</span></span><span

come here six days a week over winter vacation, except for Thursdays. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.90.3\">Even after the third semester begins, I’ll probably be coming in at night, so I don’t expect I’ll be deviating from my six-day-a-week plan for the foreseeable future. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.90.4\">If you ever have any problems, you can come to me for help, any time.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.91.1\">That was awfully specific. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.91.2\">Was there some reason he was skipping Thursdays in particular?</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.92.1\">“If you need it, I wouldn’t mind teaching you the basics and—”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.93.1\">“Oh no, that’s all right,” I said quickly, flatly declining his offer. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.93.2\">“I would feel terribly guilty bothering you for help, Mashima-sensei. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.93.3\">I will make it a priority to keep attending for a while and do some light exercise.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.93.4\">I made to leave.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.94.1\">“I see. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.94.2\">Well, you can always call on me if you need help. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.94.3\">I’ll be here at the gym as much as possible during winter vacation.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.95.1\">With my teacher’s gracious offer duly considered, I decided to go work up a proper sweat, alone. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.95.2\">I’d spent about thirty minutes working out in the gym when I noticed that the atmosphere had suddenly changed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.95.3\">Some of the students who were using the equipment turned in unison to look at something. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.95.4\">I followed their gazes, wondering what they were looking at, and saw a familiar face from my class: Kouenji.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.1\">He was the center of attention, but he didn’t seem to be paying it any mind. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.2\">He simply began his workout. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.3\">I had assumed people would be watching him because of his eccentric behavior, but apparently that was not the case. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.4\">I could faintly hear some boys from other grade levels nearby talking:</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.97.1\">“Whoa, that Kouenji dude really is incredible.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.98.1\">“Yeah, not many high schoolers would be able to do that, for sure…”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.1\">You could get a sense of his physical ability, which was above average for a high school student, through observing his workout session. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.2\">He seemed to have attracted a lot of attention as an outstanding athlete. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.3\">Indeed, even at just a glance, the height of his physical perfection was clear; his refined, toned muscles and his flexibility. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.4\">There was no wastefulness in his movements, and there was a type of seriousness about him that his usual eccentric behavior thoroughly belied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.1\">Kouenji had always given the impression that he was completely devoted to training his body. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.2\">It was no surprise that he’d be going to the gym. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.3\">In fact, no exaggeration, he was made for it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.4\">Kouenji even caught Mashima-sensei’s attention; he stopped what he was doing and watched. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.5\">Looking at him objectively, you could say that Kouenji was far, far beyond the realm of normal students.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.1\">Kouenji was blessed with a naturally good physique, and he worked out daily, sparing no effort to maintain his body. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.2\">Even here at school, Kouenji dedicated himself to the pursuit of physical excellence, no matter the time and place. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.3\">Unlike what I saw from Mashima-sensei, which was only slightly better than a total beginner could do, Kouenji’s workout regimen was truly mesmerizing. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.4\">It went without saying, too, that Kouenji was the type who got sharper and better when he was being showered with attention, rather than seeming nervous, anxious, or irritated.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.1\">“Kouenji-kun is always incredibly popular,” Ichinose said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.2\">It sounded like this kind of attention was normal for him, then. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.3\">“Good morning, Ayanokouji-kun.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.103.1\">“’Sup.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.1\">“It sure is rainy again today, isn’t it? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.2\">By the way, about how long have you been here?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.105.1\">“I got here about thirty minutes ago,” I replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.106.1\">“I see. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.106.2\">To tell you the truth, I had been planning to arrive about the same time you did, but I got caught up talking with a friend for a little, and ended up getting here late.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.107.1\">Ichinose looked up at me from where she was standing next to me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.107.2\">She was very close.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.108.1\">“It’s too bad it’s Christmas Eve today,” she said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.1\">“It’s no big deal,” I said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.2\">“It’s just like any other day.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.110.1\">“Hm. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.110.2\">Do you think girls think of a romantic day the way you do?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.111.1\">“Well…I suppose they wouldn’t.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.111.2\">As a male, I couldn’t know what days on the calendar fixated women. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.112.1\">After some light chitchat, Ichinose asked me if I’d like to work out with her on the treadmill, so I accepted. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.112.2\">We chose machines that were lined up next to each other, side-by-side, and spent the next thirty minutes running without chatting, each of us taking a pace setting that suited us.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.113.1\">“</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.114.1\">Phew</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.115.1\">, you really do feel a different sense of motivation when you’re working out with somebody else, huh?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.115.2\">said Ichinose.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.116.1\">“You might be right about that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.116.2\">It’s a good thing you’re here when Amikura is,” I replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.1\">Smiling warmly, Ichinose wiped the sweat from her forehead with a towel. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.2\">I enjoyed my time at the gym with her for about another hour. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.3\">Later, when I told Ichinose I was heading out, Amikura had just arrived. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.4\">Ichinose said that she would chat with Amikura for a while, so we split up then.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.1\">“Are you leaving already?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.2\">Noticing that I was about to leave the workout area, Mashima-sensei put his weights down and called out to me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.3\">Though he said “already,” I had been in the gym for approximately two hours by this point. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.4\">It’d been long enough.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.1\">“Yes, I am. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.2\">I’ve gotten rather worn out, after all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.3\">Sensei, do you realize that two hours have passed?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.4\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.1\">“Two hours? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.2\">Hm, that so? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.3\">Already?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.121.1\">He must have gotten so unconsciously absorbed in his workout that he really hadn’t noticed.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.122.1\">“I think you had best take a little break now, Mashima-sensei,” I suggested. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.122.2\">“You’ve gone on for approximately three hours now with hardly any rest. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.122.3\">You are building up fatigue in places that you cannot see, and that can lead to injury.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.123.1\">I was fully prepared for him to be angry with me over saying something that you would say to an amateur. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.123.2\">Far from being angry, Mashima-sensei looked surprised, and then crossed his arms.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.124.1\">“…Yes, you may be right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.124.2\">I was summoning my willpower so that I could leave my cowardly, disappointing self behind and be a good role model. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.124.3\">But it might have had the opposite effect.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.1\">Maybe there hadn’t been anyone around Mashima-sensei to have given him advice like that until now, and he really, really wanted results as soon as possible. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.2\">He wanted a strong body. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.3\">Those feelings seemed to have made him so absorbed in his workout that he forgot about his fatigue.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.1\">“All right then. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.2\">I suppose I’ll stop for the day, too.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.3\">It sounded like he intended to humbly accept the advice I had given him.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.127.1\">“See you later, then.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.127.2\">I gave him a slight bow. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.128.1\">I thought I’d go ahead and leave, but Mashima-sensei quickly chased after me.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.129.1\">“Do you mind if I talk to you for just a moment?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.129.2\">he asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.130.1\">“Huh? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.130.2\">Not at all, no,” I replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.130.3\">I thought it might be something related to the gym, but he directed me over to the rest area.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.131.1\">“Did I do something in the gym that had rubbed you the wrong way, sensei?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.131.2\">I figured I ought to ask, since I didn’t particularly know the reason I was being called away.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.1\">“Heavens no,” Mashima-sensei said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.2\">“It’s nothing like that at all, so don’t worry. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.3\">You were just fine in the gym, no problem at all,” said Mashima-sensei. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.4\">It sounded like he’d been keeping a close eye on what I was up to. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.5\">Seeing my eyes full of doubt, he lowered his gaze. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.6\">“…I have a confession to make. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.7\">I was so engrossed in my own workout that I wasn’t paying attention to my surroundings.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.1\">He furrowed his brow apologetically, confirming that I had seen through him earlier. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.2\">Seeing such a serious reaction from him actually made me feel bad. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.3\">Teachers were on winter vacation, too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.4\">They were free to enjoy their time doing whatever they wanted on campus, and they were under no obligation to monitor the students. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.5\">It was like I’d stolen some of the pleasure of being an adult from him, and we’d switched roles in a very sad way.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.134.1\">“So, the reason you wanted to talk to me—” I urged him to get on with the conversation, brushing off his apology. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.1\">Mashima-sensei quickly took one look around to make sure that no one else was around. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.2\">“Truthfully, I have a favor to ask of you,” he said. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.1\">“Okay?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.1\">Mashima-sensei steeled his posture. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.2\">Just as he was about to tell me what that favor was, a visitor arrived, and at the worst moment. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.3\">It was a woman with long, wavy, beautiful hair, one of the employees working at the gym. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.4\">When she noticed us standing there, she gave us a pleasant smile.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.138.1\">“It looks like you really gave it your best today too, Mashima-san,” she said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.1\">“Oh no, I didn’t really do all that much,” he replied, offering her a casual greeting.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.140.1\">Mashima-sensei had been going to the gym longer than I had, and it sounded as though this woman had remembered his name.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.141.1\">“And this is?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.141.2\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.1\">“Ayanokouji,” Mashima-sensei said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.2\">“He isn’t in the class that I’m in charge of, but he’s an exceptional student from Class B.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.1\">I felt a powerful slap on the back, </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.144.1\">thwack</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.145.1\">, as though Mashima-sensei were telling me to speak up and greet her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.145.2\">He might have intended for it to have been a light pat, but the blow from his well-trained body hurt.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.146.1\">“My name is

id=\"kobo.147.1\">“I’ve seen you at the reception desk a few times,” she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.147.2\">“You were with Ichinose-chan.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.148.1\">She was a staff member here, after all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.148.2\">I guess I’d left a little impression on her too, even though I’d only been coming here for a little while.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.149.1\">“Oh, I’m sorry, though,” she added, “I’m actually on break. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.149.2\">I just came to pick up something I needed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.149.3\">Please excuse me.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.150.1\">After giving us a gentle-mannered bow of her head, the attendant took several towels from the employee rack and then headed back toward the reception area, clutching the towels to her chest. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.150.2\">Perhaps Mashima-sensei had wanted to wait for her to leave, because he watched her go until she was no longer visible, without even casting a glance at me. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.151.1\">…</span></span></p>\n<p

id=\"kobo.153.1\">“Sensei?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.154.1\">“Wh-what, Ayanokouji?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.155.1\">“Oh, well, it’s just… You had something you wanted to talk to me about?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.155.2\">I reminded him.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.156.1\">“Yes, that’s right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.156.2\">Well, I did, but let’s save that talk for another time.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.157.1\">“Okay? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.157.2\">Well, if that’s the case, then…I’ll be going now.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.158.1\">I turned and made to leave, but—</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.159.1\">“Wait.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.159.2\">Mashima-sensei tightly grabbed hold of my shoulders from behind.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.160.1\">“…What now?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.161.1\">For some reason, Mashima-sensei seemed a little strange today. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.161.2\">It was like his usual calm and collected demeanor as an instructor had gotten muddied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.162.1\">“I think this too was fate,” he said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.162.2\">“I have a confession to make.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.163.1\">“You seem to have a lot of confessions to make,” I remarked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.163.2\">Even so, it seemed like he was finally getting to the heart of the matter, so that was a relief.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.164.1\">“That staff member who was just here a few moments ago. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.164.2\">Her name is Akiyama-san.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.165.1\">“I wasn’t really paying much attention, but yes, I saw that name on her name tag. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.165.2\">And?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.166.1\">“…I would like you to investigate her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.166.2\">And I would like you to be as polite and discreet as you possibly can.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.167.1\">“Huh?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.167.2\">I blinked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.168.1\">I tried to leave, but I couldn’t move: Mashima-sensei was gripping both of my shoulders with tremendous force.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.169.1\">“I have never once brought matters of a romantic nature to work before,” he said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.169.2\">“However, the situation completely changed once I started coming to the gym. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.169.3\">Knowing you, I’m sure that you can understand without me needing to go into detail.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.170.1\">“Well, yes, I understand what you’re trying to say. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.170.2\">So, you’ve taken a liking to that woman named Akiyama-san then, Mashima-sensei?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.171.1\">“…You could say that, I suppose.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.171.2\">Uh, no, that was the only thing you </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.172.1\">could</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.173.1\">say. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.173.2\">“She is a beautiful woman—despite retaining a somewhat childish face, she is a proper, mature adult.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.174.1\">“I see…” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.175.1\">She certainly was a beautiful, mature woman, but his choice of phrasing was a little off-putting.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.176.1\">“Wouldn’t the same statement apply to people like Hoshinomiya-sensei and Chabashira-sensei, for instance?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.176.2\">I asked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.176.3\">“It’s not like faculty and staff members are forbidden from falling in love with each other, is it?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.177.1\">“The rules prohibit it,” said Mashima-sensei.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.178.1\">“Oh, I see. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.178.2\">But I’m sure some teachers date in secret, right?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.179.1\">“I wouldn’t say that kind of thing never happens, no. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.179.2\">But even if it weren’t prohibited, I still wouldn’t consider dating either of them,” Mashima-sensei declared, without any equivocation.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.180.1\">“May I ask the reason why?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.180.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.181.1\">“I’m sorry, but I don’t intend to speak on that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.181.2\">Ayanokouji, you and I are teacher and student. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.181.3\">It’s not a conversation we need to have.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.182.1\">“Okay then, I’ll be leaving now. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.182.2\">After all, the conversation that we were just having right now seems like it’d be inappropriate, too,” I replied, and tried to pull away.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.183.1\">“Hoshinomiya’s personality is too relaxed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.183.2\">Chabashira-sensei’s personality is too serious. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.183.3\">That’s all,” said Mashima-sensei.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.184.1\">Well, that was simple enough. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.184.2\">Even if we were to assume that Hoshinomiya-sensei and Chabashira-sensei were equal in terms of their aesthetic value, Hoshinomiya was a lovesick, dithering girl, in love with the idea of being in love. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.184.3\">She seemed like even if she were in a relationship with someone, she was likely to continue to flirt and hang out with members of the opposite sex. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.184.4\">Chabashira-sensei, on the other hand, had clung to her love from her days as a student and hadn’t had a single relationship since. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.184.5\">If she were to find another target for her affection, I got the feeling it was likely to be a smothering, intense affair.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.185.1\">“But you can’t state with any certainty that Akiyama-san, that staff member, isn’t like them,” I replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.185.2\">You couldn’t know those sorts of things just from how someone appeared on the outside; you would find out through the process of going out with someone, and— </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.186.1\">“She is absolutely not like them,” said Mashima-sensei. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.186.2\">I was sure he didn’t have any evidence for that claim, but he denied it forcefully based solely on the strength of his assumptions. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.186.3\">“I’ve known the two of them since we were students,” he went on, “and I don’t see them as grown women, even. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.186.4\">Never have, not even once. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.186.5\">Besides, if I tried to pick between the two of them, best friends and rivals, it would have had a significant impact on my life at school.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.187.1\">“Well, I suppose you’re right about that,” I mused.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.188.1\">“Which is why I’m asking you to do this,” said Mashima-sensei.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.189.1\">“Why me, though?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.190.1\">“Do you really think I could ask one of the other instructors to do this?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.191.1\">“I suppose you have a point there,

only one I know who goes to the gym, and who seems tight-lipped and trustworthy.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.193.1\">“Wait, don’t tell me, sensei. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.193.2\">So, the reason you were so happy when you first saw me today was…?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.194.1\">“Because I had made a gym buddy, of course.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.195.1\">No, that was most definitely a lie. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.195.2\">The look in his eyes had clearly been him homing in on a student that he could use for this specific matter. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.195.3\">Knowing what I knew now, I was sure of it.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.196.1\">“You understand the things I wish to know, right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.196.2\">said Mashima-sensei.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.197.1\">“I can guess,” I replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.197.2\">“If she has a boyfriend. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.197.3\">Her preferred type. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.197.4\">Hobbies and things that she likes.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.198.1\">“Perfect, full marks. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.199.1\">I wondered if this person really was the Mashima-sensei that I was used to seeing. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.199.2\">Perhaps I should think of it as him keeping his private life and his professional life separate…but he was showing me a side of him that was just far too dissonant. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.199.3\">Still, his tone of voice was steady, and I couldn’t see anything bad at all from his facial expression.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.200.1\">“I’m not telling you to get moving right away,” he added. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"

winter vacation, or whenever. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.200.4\">Just take your time, get close to her, and investigate.”</span></span></p>\n<p

off. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.204.2\">“Every day except Thursday, right?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.205.1\">“…That’s right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.206.1\">It wasn’t really that I knew, it was more that Mashima-sensei had explicitly said that he went to the gym every day except for Thursday. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.206.2\">I’d felt like there was something off about that remark; that was why I’d figured it out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.206.3\">I was sure that he had initially gone to the gym for the purpose of working out, but now he was totally focused on

</span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.213.2\">Should I pick up the item from the store that I had decided to stop by in advance, then take a stroll around the mall and head back? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.213.3\">Mashima-sensei himself had said to take my time with his request… As I racked my brain, wondering how I would find out the information he wanted, I hoped that he would end up solving his issue himself.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.1\">It was still early in the afternoon. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.2\">If I went back to the dorm now, I’d just end up back in my room with too much time on my hands. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.3\">Instead, I took out my phone and opened my contacts. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.4\">It wasn’t a bad idea to call up a guy friend to hang out once in a while.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.216.1\">I casually skimmed through my list of contacts, and then I quietly turned my phone’s screen off. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.216.2\">I hadn’t really given it much thought, but I had hardly any experience just spontaneously calling up friends of the same

class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.220.1\">—got a blunt rejection like that in response, I’d be extremely shaken. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.221.1\">Someone like Yousuke might sympathize with how I was feeling and take me up on the offer to hang out, but if he were to spend time with me just because he was worried about me, that would give me some mixed feelings. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.221.2\">Inviting someone took significant effort, and it was difficult to boot. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.221.3\">In the end, I concluded that it was better for me to remain alone, without bothering anyone.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.222.1\">“What are friends exactly, anyway, I wonder?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.222.2\">I muttered, once again reminded that I still hadn’t excelled in this area, even though it was now the second half of my second year.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.1\">I rode the escalator down to the first floor. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.2\">It was still daytime, so the number of students had increased considerably. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.3\">If I couldn’t talk to anyone myself, was there another way? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.4\">For example, bumping into someone by coincidence, a chance encounter. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.5\">I could run into someone in an unintentional way, and then invite them out, with a </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.224.1\">“Hey, do you want to hang out right now?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.225.1\">With that thought in mind, I looked around, but I couldn’t see any of my classmates. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.225.2\">Come to think of it, someone from the same grade would—well, no. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.225.3\">I couldn’t even spot anyone in my same grade level. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.225.4\">If I just awkwardly kept looking around, searching for people, then people would probably think I was someone suspicious. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.225.5\">I quickly decided to give up on the idea of engineering a meeting with someone, and switched my goal to enjoying my time by myself.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.1\">I stopped in front of one of the many floor guide maps placed throughout the mall. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.2\">I knew the types of shops there were and their locations, but I decided to check to see if anything new might have opened. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.3\">It wasn’t like stores were replaced all that quickly, though, and I didn’t discover anything new. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.4\">But there was one store that caught my eye.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.227.1\">“Think I’ll try going there,” I thought aloud.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.1\">My idea was to visit a rental shop that I didn’t personally stop by that often. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.2\">Here, one could rent DVDs or Blu-rays of movies, anime, and so on, whether they were new or old. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.3\">The store also offered music CDs. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.4\">However, customer demand wasn’t that high here because, with the school’s permission, video content could be viewed freely at any time you wished via the internet—i.e., through a streaming service with a monthly subscription fee.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.1\">People only came to this store occasionally. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.2\">Usually, it was when there was something specific that they wanted to see. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.3\">Since it was only students like that who visited this shop, it inevitably didn’t have many customers. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.4\">That was precisely why I decided to check it out over this winter holiday. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.5\">I had a lot of time on my hands and thought it would be nice to spend my time like this now and again. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.6\">I felt like I was just making a lot of excuses earlier, but it wasn’t as though I was lonely at all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.7\">Just to be sure, I repeated those words to myself in my head. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.1\">After I had picked up the item at the store like I had planned, I arrived at the rental shop. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.2\">It wasn’t spacious at all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.3\">If anything, it was cramped, and the small space was jam-packed, crammed full of a wide variety of discs on display. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.4\">Discs were normally housed in a box or a case, but here in this store, they all appeared to come in black, transparent, stretchy protective bags, with a sheet of paper that appeared to be a printout of the back of the disc’s original packaging inserted into the bag as well. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.5\">It was designed so that you could tell what kind of media it was just at a glance.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.231.1\">When I was browsing on a computer or a tablet, I would first sift through the titles to see if any of them looked interesting, or whether anything caught my interest based on the thumbnail. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.231.2\">However, in an environment like this, where you would pick things up one by one, you’d find yourself picking up things that you wouldn’t normally check out, for whatever reason. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.231.3\">And I even found myself reading the plot synopses carefully.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.232.1\">While countless works were readily available for listening or viewing online, I imagined that I was ignoring good works of art without even noticing them. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.232.2\">With that in mind, it might not be bad for me to take my time and browse like this now and again. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.232.3\">I might even come to the rental shop more often. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.232.4\">However, a problem remained. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.232.5\">Even if I did find something that looked interesting, there wasn’t any need for me to rent it here.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.233.1\">Except in the case of a rare work that wasn’t available via streaming, most things could be viewed on demand in the privacy of your dorm without having to worry about the return deadline. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.233.2\">These kinds of rental shops were likely going to become more difficult to keep in operation in the future. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.233.3\">The same was true for electronics retailers. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.233.4\">I had heard about a trend that had become sort of the established norm, where people would first visit a store to see what the actual products were like, and then buy them online for cheap immediately afterward.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.234.1\">After spending a while checking out the video section of the store, I headed over to the music section. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.234.2\">I wasn’t normally an avid music listener myself—I’d sometimes hear a current big hit on TV or listen to some classics, but that was it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.234.3\">I didn’t have any experience purchasing music myself, nor was I particularly interested in doing so at present. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.234.4\">Which was exactly why I was exploring. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.234.5\">I hoped to have a chance encounter with someone.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.1\">There was apparently one person who had already entered this store, a store that I didn’t expect to find anyone in. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.2\">A petite student had her back to me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.3\">She was wearing headphones, and she didn’t seem to have noticed me, partly because of the BGM playing in the store. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.4\">At first, I couldn’t tell who this student was, but as I got closer, her identity snapped into focus. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.5\">It was Shiranami Chihiro, from Ichinose’s class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.6\">Although I hadn’t really spoken to her very much, I had run into her under some unusual circumstances. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.7\">Most recently, there was that time during the Uninhabited Island Special Exam and that time on the ship; we’d been in the same general area at the time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.8\">I wondered what she was listening to. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.9\">My curiosity was piqued simply because I had little knowledge of Japanese music (though, admittedly, my ignorance wasn’t just limited to Japanese music).</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.236.1\">However, Shiranami was focused on listening to her music, so she probably wouldn’t notice me even if I tried whispering to her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.236.2\">But if I aggressively closed the distance between us so that I entered her field of view, then I’d end up startling her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.236.3\">I could have just waited for her song to be over, but since trying to talk to her afterward and strike up conversation would be difficult for me—certainly not a low bar—I decided to try and get close enough so that I could pick up on what she was listening to. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.236.4\">Meanwhile, I pretended to nonchalantly check out the products on display, so as not to appear suspicious to an outside observer.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.239.1\">I guess I ended up startling her.</span></span><span

might have approached her too carelessly due to my curiosity over what she was listening to. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.2\">Panicking, she hurriedly removed her headphones.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.1\">“A-Ayanokouji-kun?!” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.242.1\">“Sorry. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.242.2\">I didn’t mean to scare you.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.243.1\">Since she had taken her headphones off her ears, the music was clearly audible now. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.243.2\">I could hear a somewhat sorrowful guitar, along with a woman’s voice.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.244.1\">“Only time can heal my wounded heart. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.244.2\">Now, he’s someone else’s—”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.245.1\">A song about lost love, huh? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.245.2\">I heard part of a lyric that sounded like that kind of song, but Shiranami, flustered, hurriedly pressed the button and the song ended.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.246.1\">“Wh-wh-wh-what do you want?!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.246.2\">she stammered, still reeling.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.247.1\">“Well, no, it’s… I don’t really need anything,” I said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.247.2\">“I was just wondering what you were listening to. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.247.3\">That’s all.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.248.1\">Even though I gave her an honest answer, whether she would understand was another story. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.248.2\">We were from different classes, and we weren’t particularly close; we had the sort of relationship where we didn’t talk unless it was by chance. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.248.3\">And, on top of that, when you considered the gender divide, she might be nervous about me…</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.249.1\">“Sorry to have bothered you,” I said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.249.2\">“I’ll be going now.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.250.1\">Me being near Shiranami any longer for no good reason at all would only bother her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.250.2\">The only thing I could do was leave, and quickly.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.251.1\">“Um… Hold on,” she squeaked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.252.1\">It seemed like Shiranami wanted to say something. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.252.2\">At the very least, I could tell that she wasn’t the type of girl who could speak eloquently with people that she didn’t have a close relationship with. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.252.3\">Having said that, I was sure that if I urged her to speak, like I was demanding, it would end up causing her to swallow what she was about to say, and the words would remain stuck in her throat. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.252.4\">Which was why I kept my eyes fixed, not on Shiranami’s eyes directly, but rather on a spot not too far away. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.252.5\">I waited for the right time, doing as much as I could to create an environment where she could talk without panicking.</span></span></p>\n</div></div>",
