class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.1.1\">The path was lined with several thick-trunked trees, which made it easy to hide. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.1.2\">Managing to keep Ryuuen and Katsuragi from noticing her presence as she followed us on our walk was quite a feat.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.1\">“N-no, that’s…” Yamamura tried to talk her way out of it at first, but she seemed to give up almost immediately, perhaps because I had correctly identified her position. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.2\">“How…d-did you know?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.3.1\">“How?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.3.2\">I repeated.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.4.1\">I don’t know, I just did</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.1\">. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.2\">That’s what I thought at first, but the old me probably wouldn’t have paid any attention to Yamamura’s presence at all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.3\">Also, we had spent time together during the school trip, so I’d already had her in mind. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.4\">To use an analogy, think of it like an image. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.5\">At first glance, its shape and composition just looks like A. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.6\">But when you change your viewpoint and see that the shape and composition is B. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.7\">From that point onward, you can’t help but perceive the image not as A, but as B. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.8\">This scenario might have been something like that.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.1\">She went from simply being Female Student A from another class to me, to being Yamamura Miki. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.2\">That was all there was to it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.3\">I had known that I was being followed and that some of my earlier conversation with Ryuuen and Katsuragi had been overheard, but I didn’t do anything to stop it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.4\">Yamamura was a student from Class A and an ally of Sakayanagi’s. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.5\">If she were engaged in some covert operation, telling Ryuuen and Katsuragi about it would mean that I was supporting them. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.6\">Of course, while I was free to support them, that wasn’t in my best interests at present.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.1\">“Relax. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.2\">There wasn’t any indication that Ryuuen or Katsuragi noticed,” I told her.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.1\">“Really? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.2\">It felt like Ryuuen-kun was trying to lure me out into the open, though…” said Yamamura.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.1\">Yamamura’s hunch was probably correct. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.2\">Ryuuen didn’t stay in one spot; he deliberately went around to conspicuous places. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.3\">I thought he was probably trying to catch his prey in a trap. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.4\">It all seemed like Ryuuen had been playing with his food.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.1\">“If that’s the case, then you don’t even need to ask me whether they found out, do you?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.2\">I pointed out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.3\">Yamamura must have been certain that no one had discovered her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.4\">Otherwise, she wouldn’t have looked so surprised when I found her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.5\">“It seems like you weren’t just tailing yesterday and today.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.1\">She neither confirmed nor denied it, instead responding with silence. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.2\">Yamamura was good at tailing people, and even though Ryuuen was rather wary, she had performed excellently. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.3\">Once it became clear to Ryuuen that his attempt to lure her out wouldn’t work, he was probably forced to give up. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.4\">I couldn’t see any signs of him following me after we’d gone our separate ways, either. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.5\">That was another reason I was able to approach Yamamura with peace of mind.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.1\">“To be honest, I wasn’t sure whether to come up and talk to you,” I went on. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.2\">“But we were in the same group during the school trip, so I thought I’d at least say hello.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.1\">Given I’d noticed her presence, not talking to Yamamura would have been like ignoring her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.2\">I supposed it felt odd to me to ignore a familiar face when I encountered them somewhere that wasn’t that busy. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.3\">In fact, by now I was fairly sure that Yamamura would have concluded that I hadn’t discovered her and must have been hoping I’d just look the other way.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.1\">“You’re not…going to ask me the reason I’ve been tailing him?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.2\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.1\">It had been confirmed that Sakayanagi and Ryuuen would be facing off in the final exams—that Ryuuen wanted to fight Sakayanagi. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.2\">Sakayanagi likely wanted to know Ryuuen’s every move and aim, and there wasn’t any harm in gathering information.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.1\">“I don’t need to ask,” I replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.1\">“I see.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.1\">“You can rest easy, I have no intention of reporting anything about you to Ryuuen.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.2\">I thought that just saying those two hadn’t noticed her would be enough to reassure her.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.1\">“But…it looked like you were friendly with them, Ayanokouji-kun. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.2\">At the very least, it didn’t seem as though you perceive them as your enemies. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.3\">Which means, if you put it another way, that you’re on Ryuuen-kun’s side, right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.4\">Yamamura’s words were laced with doubt, as though she were asking a question.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.1\">“Sorry, but I’m not on Ryuuen’s side,” I replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.2\">“That being said though, it’s not like I’m on Class A’s side, either. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.3\">Anyway, I don’t intend to tell anyone that I met you here. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.4\">You can trust me on that.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.1\">“…Really?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.1\">Just as I was about to give her a nod to dispel her anxiety, the faint sound of footsteps caused my neck to go stiff. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.2\">The next thing I knew, I heard the slow, repeated sound of dry clapping.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.1\">“I knew you’d come through, Ayanokouji,” Ryuuen drawled. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.2\">“Great work on finding the rat.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.1\">Yamamura had already taken her eyes off me to look at him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.2\">He had seemed to disappear so completely, but now he suddenly made himself known… So, that’s how it was, huh?</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.25.1\">“Guessin’ you’re probably the one that Sakayanagi bitch told to collect information about me, eh?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.25.2\">he said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.1\">“It’s not like that…” Even though she denied it, she couldn’t deceive Ryuuen at all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.2\">She wasn’t a good actor.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.1\">Ryuuen chuckled. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.2\">“Looks like I made the right choice following you, Ayanokouji. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.3\">Even someone as observant as you—you let your guard down just ’cause no one’s chasing you. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.4\">Right?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.1\">He was exactly right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.2\">I was confident that if someone were obviously following me, whether it be Ryuuen or anyone else, I would notice them. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.3\">But apparently Ryuuen had outmaneuvered me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.4\">There were only two paths I could have taken from the spot where Ryuuen and I had parted ways: I could have either chosen the path leading to Keyaki Mall or the path leading to the school and dormitory. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.5\">Ryuuen had disappeared inside Keyaki Mall.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.1\">Even if he did follow me afterward, if he stayed at a distance where he wouldn’t be spotted or if he quickly went after me after waiting for a period of time first, there was a good chance that he would catch up with me naturally. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.2\">No matter how sensitive my radar was, if no one was actually tailing me, there was nothing I could do to prevent him from following. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.3\">The reason Ryuuen had pressed me for an answer earlier, about whether I was going to Keyaki Mall, was to narrow down the route I was going to take.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.1\">Moreover…</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.1\">I felt even more apologetic toward Yamamura when I saw Katsuragi coming back too, just ahead of me.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.1\">“I hadn’t imagined there was a connection between Yamamura and Sakayanagi,” he remarked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.33.1\">Katsuragi looked surprised to see that she must have been the one conducting reconnaissance. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.33.2\">I guessed that meant he was a necessary part of the operation to smoke out the person who was watching them, scouting the area for people under the pretense he had left, huh?</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.1\">“Sorry, Ayanokouji,” he added. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.2\">“I only came back when Ryuuen called me just a few minutes ago.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.1\">So, Ryuuen had figured that if he were going to track his target down anyway, his chances of success would improve if he got Katsuragi involved. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.2\">That was his move. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.3\">From the sounds of it, Ryuuen hadn’t even told his allies anything about this plan of his, so that they wouldn’t perceive anything unnatural about it.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.1\">“Is it surprising that she’s connected to Sakayanagi?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.1\">“Yeah,” said Katsuragi. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.2\">“There weren’t any signs that she had any such relationship with Sakayanagi when I was in their class, at the very least. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.3\">I assumed that, at best, she was nothing more than just one of many scouts.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.1\">Was that something Katsuragi had a particularly good understanding of because of his time in that class, then? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.2\">Obviously, Yamamura was in far more trouble than she had been before.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.1\">“Pft, even though I went through all this hassle, all I could catch was one small fry, huh?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.2\">Ryuuen scoffed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.3\">“I was expectin’ Hashimoto or someone… Or were you given the job because Sakayanagi trusts you?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.1\">Ryuuen’s sharp gaze pierced Yamamura, heavy with suspicion. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.2\">She hadn’t expected to find herself surrounded, and she couldn’t hide her anxiety—which, conversely, prevented her from realizing that her very anxiety answered Ryuuen’s question.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.1\">“I gotta say, your powers of observation are top-notch, Ayanokouji. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.2\">But your role for today is done.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.3\">Ryuuen dismissed me; his target was the frightened Yamamura. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.4\">“If Sakayanagi thinks she can beat me just by sneakin’ around and spyin’ on me, then she ain’t no big deal neither.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.1\">Even if I hadn’t spotted Yamamura this time and she had been able to keep on gathering information over and over, whether that would allow her to pass useful information on to Sakayanagi was another matter. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.2\">If you wanted to establish contact with someone without letting anyone else find out about it, then naturally, you wouldn’t do it outdoors. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.3\">Inside the room of an ally who wouldn’t betray you, inside a karaoke room, or in the restrooms, if you were the same sex. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.4\">It would be easy to simply go about your normal business without drawing suspicion.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.1\">However, for Sakayanagi, there were some things she couldn’t do anything about. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.2\">Information was a necessity, and Ryuuen must have been investigating Class A in just the same way they were investigating him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.3\">But unlike Ryuuen, who could gather information even on his own, Sakayanagi had difficulty in that regard. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.4\">She had to use students like Yamamura, Kamuro, and Hashimoto to gather information for her.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.1\">“Y’know, it sure doesn’t feel too good, havin’ somebody stick their nose in your business,” sneered Ryuuen.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.1\">“Do you have any integrity at all?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.2\">Katsuragi asked him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.3\">“You’re investigating Sakayanagi in much the same way.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.46.1\">The surveillance operation wasn’t a one-sided affair. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.46.2\">It sounded like they were investigating each other, perhaps in preparation for final exams at the end of the year.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.1\">“In that case, you gonna do somethin’ different? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.2\">If you’ve got a better idea, then I’m all ears, Katsuragi.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.48.1\">Ryuuen’s implicit suggestion was that they set a trap for Sakayanagi, but Katsuragi rejected the idea. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.48.2\">“I do not intend to make any major moves. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.48.3\">Keeping an eye on Sakayanagi is the only move we need to make right now.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.49.1\">Katsuragi and Ryuuen glared at one another in a standoff, maintaining their physical distance. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.49.2\">It seemed like Katsuragi especially was on his guard.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.50.1\">“Don’t forget,” he added, “it’s only the special exam that will decide who wins, not what happens off the battlefield.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.51.1\">“Oh, for the love of…” Ryuuen sighed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.51.2\">“You’re a stubborn mule.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.51.3\">Ryuuen and Katsuragi’s fundamental plans of action were practically opposites of each other. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.51.4\">But even so, Ryuuen happily listened to what Katsuragi had to say, and smiled in response. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.51.5\">He turned to Yamamura. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.51.6\">“Okay, let’s you and us hang out for a little while, huh?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.1\">“Stop,” commanded Katsuragi.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.1\">“Huh? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.2\">Stop? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.3\">We finally caught her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.4\">We gotta grill ’er for information, otherwise it’s a waste.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.1\">“You intend to stoop to threats? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.2\">Just finding out about Yamamura’s role is good enough,” said Katsuragi. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.3\">He turned to Yamamura, shooing her with his hand. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.4\">“Go. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.5\">Now.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.1\">“P-please excuse me…” she stammered, clearly eager to escape.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.56.1\">But Ryuuen wasn’t going to let that happen. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.56.2\">“Wait,” he barked, and she stopped in her tracks with a startled yelp. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.56.3\">Frozen in place, she was like a frog being eyed up by a snake.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.57.1\">“We’ll keep quiet about the fact we found you,” he said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.58.1\">“Why…?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.58.2\">asked Yamamura.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.59.1\">“Because you look so pathetic. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.59.2\">I’m sure I don’t need to tell you what’ll happen if Sakayanagi finds out we found you, right?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.60.1\">“I…” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.1\">“We didn’t find you. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.2\">Got it? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.3\">You won’t lose your value if you don’t report this. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.4\">It’s up to you whether to believe me or not, I guess.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.5\">Ryuuen spoke as though he were dangling a thread of salvation above her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.6\">“If you can’t keep your trap shut, then go tell your boss this: ‘If you want information about me, come to my room, alone, anytime you want.’ </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.7\">That is, if she’s got the guts, and you got the guts to tell her.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.62.1\">Yamamura responded with a meek nod and then quietly started to leave. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.62.2\">Perhaps she was intending to head back to the dormitory via Keyaki Mall, since she was heading in that direction. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.62.3\">After Yamamura had gotten far enough away, Katsuragi aggressively drew up to Ryuuen.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.63.1\">“Ryuuen…! </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.63.2\">You barbarian!” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.64.1\">“What?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.1\">“Your ‘preference’ certainly is not praiseworthy.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.1\">“Huh?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.1\">“I won’t tell you not to be interested in the opposite sex,” Katsuragi told him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.2\">“But Sakayanagi is a child. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.3\">She is not someone you should lay a hand on.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.1\">I was wondering what Katsuragi was about to say with such a serious look on his face, and he came out and gave Ryuuen an absurd warning. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.2\">That was his interpretation of the “come to my room” part of Ryuuen’s earlier statement. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.3\">That had been a joke on Ryuuen’s part, but I supposed Katsuragi didn’t get it.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.69.1\">“There are quite a few girls in this school, too. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.69.2\">Don’t do anything rash,” added Katsuragi.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.1\">“What kinda stupid shit are you goin’ on about, you dumb bastard?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.2\">Ryuuen retorted. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.3\">“Do you seriously think I’d have any interest in that cocky little brat? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.4\">I was just getting her going.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.71.1\">“Hm? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.71.2\">Wait, no, but you just said to have her come visit you in your room, alone. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.71.3\">Isn’t that what you meant?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.72.1\">Ryuuen, shaking his head in exasperation, proceeded to go back and address Katsuragi’s original argument. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.72.2\">“It ain’t my ‘preference’ or whatever. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.72.3\">Anyway, Sakayanagi’s the same age as the rest of us, ain’t she?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.73.1\">Katsuragi seemed to think it was fine to lay a hand on someone your own age, but not Sakayanagi. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.73.2\">Apparently he hadn’t noticed this himself until now, because he froze, lost in thought for a while. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.73.3\">Then, finally understanding the meaning behind Ryuuen’s statement, he came back to Earth.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.1\">“…Yes, you’re certainly right,” he conceded. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.2\">“It’s just, well, her size makes her look younger. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.3\">She’s even smaller than my little sister! </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.4\">I can’t help but—”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.75.1\">While Katsuragi did perceive Sakayanagi to be a strong enemy, he was also an older brother. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.75.2\">Sakayanagi reminded him of his little sister, who he hadn’t seen in a while, so his sense of righteousness had probably gotten the better of him, making him feel that it wouldn’t be right for Sakayanagi to be regarded as a sexual object. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.75.3\">One thing was for certain: if Sakayanagi heard what these two were saying, she would be angry. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.75.4\">They were clearly treating her like a child based solely on her appearance.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.76.1\">“’Sides, when it comes to chicks, normal is best, as far as I’m concerned,” Ryuuen said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.76.2\">“I ain’t got a preference for anythin’ too flashy, anythin’ too plain, too big or too small.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.77.1\">Not that I wanted to know, but apparently, Ryuuen’s type was extremely ordinary women. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.77.2\">Rather than sounding like a selfish wish on his part, it sounded more like a mature preference, based on being experienced in the ways of the world, on things bitter and sweet. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.77.3\">I didn’t know about his life here in high school now, but I guessed that he must have had some experience with girls when he was in junior high.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.1\">“I am relieved that you haven’t fallen as far as I had thought,” said Katsuragi. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.78.2\">Whatever he felt relieved by, it was a problem he’d made up himself.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.1\">“What? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.2\">You still got somethin’ to say, Ayanokouji?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.3\">asked Ryuuen.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.80.1\">“That’s a rather rude way of speaking to me, after you used me for your own convenience,” I answered.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.81.1\">“It’s your own fault for gettin’ used,” he sneered. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.81.2\">“If you wanna hold a grudge, blame your own bad intuition.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.82.1\">It was certainly true that there was no point in holding it against Ryuuen that he’d pulled one over on me in this situation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.82.2\">Even so, it was tough, because it didn’t seem like I could use this as a lesson for the future. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.82.3\">Following someone by deliberately choosing </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.83.1\">not</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.1\"> to follow them closely. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.2\">Even if Ryuuen tried the same trick again, it would be difficult for me to stop it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.3\">Being vigilant even when you didn’t sense any signs of anything would only be paranoid.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.1\">Keeping the thought in mind that I could be followed everywhere I went was going to hang over me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.2\">Anyway, there wasn’t any point in staying around here. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.85.3\">I still had some things I wanted to talk to Yamamura about, and I might be able to catch up with her if I left now.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.86.1\">As soon as I started in the direction of Keyaki Mall, Ryuuen called out to me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.86.2\">“Weren’t ya headin’ back?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.87.1\">“There are countless routes within the mall,” I replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.87.2\">“I don’t want you chasing after me any more today.” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.88.1\">Ryuuen responded with a scornful chuckle when he heard I needed multiple escape routes to get away from him.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span

id=\"kobo.94.1\">now that I’ve entered Keyaki Mall, what to do about Yamamura?</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.95.1\"> I wondered. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.95.2\">It was possible that she already left via another exit to head back to the dormitory, but…</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.1\">I tried putting myself in Yamamura’s shoes, to figure out what I’d do in her position. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.2\">I was sure she must be agonizing over whether to report her blunder to Sakayanagi, that she had ultimately been discovered when tailing Ryuuen. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.3\">People sought somewhere peaceful when they were feeling mentally and emotionally unstable. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.96.4\">If I were to operate under the assumption she hadn’t made a beeline back to the dormitory, for her own safety, and she remained here in the mall, where would she be?</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.97.1\">Yamamura was the sort of person who hated crowds and preferred to be alone, so any places with lots of people coming and going could be ruled out, and so could store interiors. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.97.2\">She might be alone in a karaoke room, but going in there solo would have required a lot of work. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.97.3\">A private restroom was a relatively highly likely candidate, but I couldn’t imagine that she wouldn’t have a sense of hesitation over preventing other people from using it.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.98.1\">In that case…</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.1\">Earlier, she’d hidden in the space between the outdoor vending machines and some decorative plants. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.2\">There were several vending machines installed in the back of the mall too, near the rest area. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.3\">Since they were over in that area, they were less conspicuous and not visited as often. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.4\">As an added blessing, perhaps due to the time of day, I couldn’t see any sign of anyone near the rest area, either. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.5\">And there were no other people by the vending machines further back, naturally. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.6\">I approached and stealthily took a peek around the side of the vending machines, into the blind spot.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.1\">“Huh?!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.2\">Yamamura squeaked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.1\">I found her sitting next to the vending machine, holding a small plastic bottle of tea in both hands. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.2\">She dropped her tea in shock, but fortunately the cap was on, so it was okay.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.1\">“So, you really were here after all,” I said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.103.1\">Although I’d narrowed down the list, I’d come here without any evidence. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.103.2\">But still… I picked up the plastic bottle that rolled on the floor and handed it to Yamamura.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.1\">“H-h-h-how did you know I was here…?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.2\">Flustered, she searched her pockets.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.105.1\">“Um, no, I didn’t plant a GPS tracker on you or anything.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.106.1\">“B-but, I can’t think of anything else th—d-did you maybe track my phone’s location…?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.107.1\">“No, I didn’t.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.108.1\">Those were outlandish fantasies on her part, but I supposed she was just so shocked that it made her want to explain it that way. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.108.2\">She stood up and took a little peek out from the vending machines, to check her surroundings.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.1\">“If you’re looking for Ryuuen and Katsuragi, they aren’t here,” I assured her.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.110.1\">“I-I see… U-um, do you have some business with me still?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.110.2\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.111.1\">“I didn’t apologize for what happened earlier. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.111.2\">I’m sorry, Yamamura. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.111.3\">If I hadn’t called out to you, they wouldn’t have found you.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.111.4\">If I hadn’t done that, then there wouldn’t have been the need for her to sit around worrying by the vending machines like this right now.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.112.1\">But Yamamura responded politely, not outwardly blaming me at all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.112.2\">“It was my fault that you found me, Ayanokouji-kun, so… Please don’t worry about it.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.113.1\">“Have you reported to Sakayanagi that you were found?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.113.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.114.1\">“Well, yes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.114.2\">I told her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.114.3\">I think this means my role is finished now.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.114.4\">A surprisingly frank answer. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.114.5\">It looked like she was at a loss over Ryuuen’s rasped invitation, but… Well, I supposed, if she had already reported it, then there was no need to worry about that anymore. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.114.6\">As for me, though, there were still some things I had to do for Yamamura.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.115.1\">“Let me make it up to you, somehow,” I offered.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.116.1\">“…Huh?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.1\">We had been in the same group during the school trip; it wouldn’t be surprising if Yamamura and Kitou had been monitoring Ryuuen then. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.2\">Chances were high that Sakayanagi would have instructed them to simply watch him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.3\">Even without direct orders, if they were in the same group, it would only be natural for them to keep a watchful eye on Ryuuen. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.117.4\">Yamamura was constantly alert, concerned about everything, even the movements of Ichinose’s class, too.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.1\">But in this case, things were completely different. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.2\">The surprise that Katsuragi had shown. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.3\">The fact that Sakayanagi could be using Yamamura as an asset and spy. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.4\">Ryuuen’s analysis of the strength that Sakayanagi’s class possessed had advanced one step further from this fact. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.5\">From this point forward, Ryuuen’s response in dealing with Yamamura would be more intense. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.118.6\">If I hadn’t noticed Yamamura and carelessly called out to her earlier, then it was highly likely that Ryuuen and Katsuragi wouldn’t have been able to capture her, and there would have been no need for me to apologize to her.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.1\">“You don’t have to make it up to me or anything like that,” she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.119.2\">“This matter has nothing to do with you, Ayanokouji-kun, you’re in a different class.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.1\">She was exactly right on that point, but I was looking ahead to something. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.2\">It wasn’t something I wanted to explain to anyone yet, though, so I thought up another reason. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.3\">“It’s simply because I feel bad about this. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.120.4\">No matter how you slice it, all I’ve done is create problems for you, Yamamura.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.121.1\">“But… Wouldn’t you say that I was the one in the wrong in the first place, for spying on people?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.122.1\">Yamamura felt guilty, then. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.122.2\">That was probably why she wasn’t complaining about the situation, even to the person who caused it.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.123.1\">“Really, it’s all right, you don’t have to worry about it anymore,” she insisted.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.124.1\">It sounded like it was going to be a challenge to get a good response out of Yamamura here. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.124.2\">If anything, if I dragged this out, all I’d achieve would be making her feel embarrassed and perplexed.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.1\">“All right,” I said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.2\">“In that case, if you’re ever in trouble, come and talk to me, anytime. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.3\">I’m not sure if I can be of any help to you, but let me know.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.4\">If I put it like that, then even Yamamura should be able to accept it without any difficulty. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.5\">It was out of my hands, now. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.125.6\">It’d be up to Yamamura to reach out and contact me if she needed something.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.1\">Yamamura nodded in acceptance. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.2\">“Okay. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.126.3\">I understand.” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.127.1\">“All right then, I guess I’ll be going now.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.128.1\">“…Take care.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.129.1\">Yamamura didn’t move from out front of the vending machines—she must have been intending to stay here a while. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.129.2\">Having said my goodbyes, I moved to leave, but then…</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.130.1\">Just as soon as I turned around, I saw Kei and Satou walking toward me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.130.2\">I reflexively hid by the vending machines, with Yamamura behind me.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.131.1\">“A-Ayanokouji-kun…?!” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.1\">Poor Yamamura was bewildered by what was going on, but I placed my index finger to my lips, telling her to be quiet. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.132.2\">She must have understood because she quickly went silent.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.1\">“Hey, so, where do you wanna go next?!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.133.2\">I heard Satou ask.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.134.1\">“Hm, let’s see,” Kei replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.1\">Only the sound of their voices from their joyful conversation reached me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.2\">They drew closer. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.3\">If they cast a casual glance in this direction, they likely wouldn’t be able to see me, but that would change if they had any business with the vending machines. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.135.4\">No matter how hidden I was now, I’d be in full view if they approached to buy something.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.1\">“Hey, how about we take a little break? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.2\">Want something to drink?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.136.3\">asked Satou, proposing the worst-case scenario for me.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.1\">“Hmm.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.137.2\">Kei sounded unsure.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.138.1\">If they did find me now, I’m sure that the fact that I was here hiding would come back to bite me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.138.2\">I was huddled closely together with someone of the opposite sex in a narrow space between the vending machines. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.138.3\">It would be difficult to make the excuse that there was nothing going on.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.139.1\">“Yeah, maybe we should take a break for a minute, sure,” said Kei.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.140.1\">“Yeah, that’s a good idea. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.140.2\">You’re just getting over being sick,” said Satou.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.141.1\">For a moment, I was prepared for what was to come, resigning myself. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.141.2\">But it looked as if they didn’t intend to use the vending machines after all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.141.3\">They were just going to take a breather on the bench in the rest area. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.141.4\">However, it wasn’t like the problem was now solved. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.141.5\">There was only one escape route from my hiding place, and as long as Kei and Satou were sitting on the bench, I couldn’t leave.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.1\">“Thanks. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.142.2\">I’m really sorry for making you worry about me and stuff</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.143.1\">,</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.144.1\">” said Kei.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.145.1\">“Nah, it’s not that big a deal,” Satou replied. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.145.2\">“I mean, it’s, like, perfectly normal for friends to help out when you get a cold.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.146.1\">“Yeah, if you ever get sick, I’ll definitely take care of you, Maya-chan.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.147.1\">“Thanks. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.147.2\">That makes me happy.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.148.1\">“You know, Maya-chan, it’s like, you’re always there, supporting me.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.149.1\">“R-really?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.150.1\">“Do you remember when we weren’t as close friends as we are now, and you were pressing me about Kiyotaka, Maya-chan?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.150.2\">Kei asked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.150.3\">“Like, you know, when we just started our second year.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.151.1\">“Oh, you mean when I asked you when you started liking Ayanokouji-kun? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.151.2\">I was all like, ‘Don’t dodge the question, tell me…’ Or something like that, I think.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.151.3\">For some reason, Satou seemed to be somewhat embarrassed to recall it, turning red as she hid her face with her hands.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.152.1\">“Yeah, yeah,” said Kei. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.152.2\">“It was like, you just cut straight to it with zero chill and, like, wouldn’t let me get out of it…” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.1\">They were speaking at a normal volume, but I could hear their voices well as they carried over to this quiet area. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.2\">Yamamura wordlessly looked up at me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.3\">I lightly raised one hand, a way of offering her an apology for making her be here for a conversation she probably didn’t want to hear. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.4\">If she didn’t want to hear it, she didn’t need to force herself for my sake. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.153.5\">If she covered her ears with her hands, she could block the sound out with minimal difficulty.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.154.1\">However, to my surprise, Yamamura seemed to be enjoying this a little. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.154.2\">She listened to their conversation in silence, with an air of interest. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.154.3\">Yamamura must have been assigned the role of collecting information on people daily, on Sakayanagi’s orders. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.154.4\">If that was true, then something like listening in on others must have been an ordinary, everyday occurrence for her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.154.5\">Anyone might find enjoyment in playing detective if they were to take part in some covert operation once or twice, but not many would be able to eavesdrop on truly private conversations without any feelings of guilt.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.155.1\">I had assumed that Yamamura herself would be tired of handling such a role, but apparently, that was not the case. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.155.2\">That, combined with her natural ability to make effective use of her lack of presence, made her extremely at home in the role. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.156.1\">Satou and Kei talked for a while, but eventually, their break came to an end.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.157.1\">“I think it’s time we get going,” Kei said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.158.1\">“Are you feeling okay already?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.158.2\">asked Satou.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.159.1\">“Yeah. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.159.2\">It’s been a while since we’ve been out, so we gotta have lots of fun today, y’know?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.160.1\">“Yeah, totally. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.160.2\">But, make sure you make up with Ayanokouji-kun, okay?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.160.3\">Satou reminded her.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.161.1\">“Y-yeah. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.161.2\">I’ll do my best…!” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.162.1\">Those last words I heard from both of them came while they were already a ways away. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.162.2\">At that time, I thought of telling Yamamura that we should remain here for a while because of the risk that the two of them might unexpectedly turn around and come back, but before I could do anything, Yamamura gently stopped me from making a move with a wave of her hand. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.163.1\">After a few moments longer, I figured we should be okay. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.163.2\">As that thought went through my mind, Yamamura made her move.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.164.1\">“I think they’ve gone,” she said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.165.1\">“Yeah.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.166.1\">First, Yamamura crept out from behind the vending machines ahead of me, and after making sure that there wouldn’t be any problems even if we left now, she gave me a small signal to join her.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.167.1\">“You really are quite deft,” I remarked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.168.1\">“Really? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.168.2\">I’m always doing this sort of thing, so…” Yamamura quietly cleared her throat, and then said something unexpected. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.168.3\">“Are you going to make up with Karuizawa-san, properly?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.169.1\">“Why do you sound like Satou?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.169.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.170.1\">“Because I’m curious, I guess. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.170.2\">She’s your girlfriend, isn’t she? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.170.3\">I didn’t know that you were fighting.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.171.1\">“I guess there are things even an information gathering specialist doesn’t know.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.172.1\">“Are you teasing me?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.173.1\">“Look who’s talking.” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.173.2\">Yamamura looked a little surprised at my comeback, but then the corners of her mouth relaxed ever so slightly into a smile.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.174.1\">“It’s kind of strange,” she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.174.2\">“You’re a mysterious person, Ayanokouji-kun.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.175.1\">“So I’m told.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.176.1\">“Is that true? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.176.2\">Or is that a joke, too?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.176.3\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.177.1\">“We may never know,” I replied.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.178.1\">Although Yamamura still seemed quite reserved, she spoke calmly, and her manner of speaking was easy to understand and not unpleasant. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.178.2\">Perhaps it was because she always seemed to be so mellow, so low energy, she somehow reminded me of myself.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.179.1\">“By the way… What about my earlier question?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.179.2\">she asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.180.1\">“You didn’t forget, huh?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.181.1\">“I remember.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.182.1\">Perhaps it was because Yamamura was so persistent in some regards, or because this experience had taken down one of her walls, but she came out and pressed me on her question once again.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.183.1\">“I will make up with her, properly,” I answered. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.183.2\">“I’ve made plans to do so.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.184.1\">“I’m glad to hear that,” said Yamamura. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.184.2\">This matter had nothing to do with her, nor should she have had any contact with Karuizawa, and yet she seemed somewhat happy.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.185.1\">“You don’t have to report that to Sakayanagi,” I added.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.186.1\">“I can’t make any promises.” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.187.1\">“Harsh.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.188.1\">After catching her breath, Yamamura took out her cell phone and looked at the dark screen. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.188.2\">She hesitated a moment, then turned to look at me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.188.3\">“About that matter with Ryuuen-kun earlier… To tell you the truth, I actually haven’t reported it yet.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.189.1\">“About you being found?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.190.1\">“Yes… I’m sorry for lying to you. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.190.2\">It was because I wanted you to leave as soon as possible…” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.191.1\">“I see.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.192.1\">“I understand that I have to report it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.192.2\">But…I think maybe I’m afraid of being thrown away. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.192.3\">I have nothing else to offer. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.192.4\">This was the only thing I’m good at. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.192.5\">If she sees that I can’t even do this, then…I’ll be useless, even in my own class.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.193.1\">I guessed that things like Academic Ability and Physical Ability didn’t matter so much; it wasn’t about those things. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.193.2\">Yamamura had low self-esteem and couldn’t see how much she had to offer.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.194.1\">“I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to have me take the blame for this, but I’m guessing that’s not what this is about,” I said.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.195.1\">Whether it was Yamamura’s fault or mine, once the truth was revealed, the important thing to Sakayanagi would be the fact that Yamamura had been discovered. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.195.2\">There was no changing the fact that it would weaken Yamamura’s potential as a future operative.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.196.1\">“I wonder if I should keep quiet about this…” she said. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.197.1\">“Do you believe what Ryuuen said?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.197.2\">I asked.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.198.1\">“The only way for me to survive right now is to put my faith in that, I

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.201.1\">Deciding to put off disclosing her failure. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.202.1\">“That would be the worst possible choice,” I told her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.202.2\">“Ryuuen is just exploiting an opening in your heart, and he will definitely expose the truth if it’s necessary. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.202.3\">Even if you do manage to get him expelled, there’s still a risk that he’d do it as a parting gift.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.203.1\">For Ryuuen, uncovering Yamamura wasn’t a major advantage. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.203.2\">However, if Yamamura didn’t report on her discovery, then he would be able to use that to his advantage. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.203.3\">It could cost everyone far more than Yamamura just being relieved of her position.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.204.1\">“Don’t be taken advantage of so easily,”

id=\"kobo.209.1\">“I-I—” Yamamura clasped her hands together tightly, then brought them up to her face, covering her eyes. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.209.2\">Then, afterward, she opened her eyes wide, took out her phone, and composed a message.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.210.1\">“</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.211.1\">Ryuuen-kun and Katsuragi-kun discovered that I was tailing them. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.211.2\">I will call you with the details.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.212.1\">After showing me the message that she had typed, Yamamura sent it to Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.213.1\">“I felt that if I hesitated, I might end up running away again,” she said. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.213.2\">It sounded as though she had decided to close off the path of retreat by reporting the matter to Sakayanagi right here and now.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.1\">“U-um. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.2\">I think it’s time,” she said nervously. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.3\">“I… If you’ll please excuse me…!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.4\">Perhaps it was because Yamamura suddenly felt uncomfortable about this situation, but she hurriedly announced she was leaving, bringing the conversation to an abrupt end. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.214.5\">Yamamura bowed deeply to me, even though she didn’t have to, before walking away timidly.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.215.1\">“She’s easy to talk to, even more than I had imagined she’d be,” I thought aloud. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.215.2\">It was true—I had told her this earlier myself, but I honestly felt that I did not want her to get expelled. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.215.3\">I didn’t think that Sakayanagi would punish Yamamura when she reported the incident, but I figured it would be a good idea to keep a close eye on her in the days to come, to be safe.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.216.1\">“Oh, oops… That’s right. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.216.2\">I should contact Horikita, just in case,” I muttered.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.217.1\">A phone call would have been too much of a hassle, so I figured that it would be best to just summarize the key points in a text message and send that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.217.2\">Besides, Kei and Satou were in the middle of having fun in Keyaki Mall right now. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.217.3\">I decided to leave the mall—it would be best to call it a day and head back so as not to run into them.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.218.1\"> </span></p>\n<p

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.222.1\">HAT EVENING,</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.1\"> with utmost reverence, I performed the ceremony of unboxing the product that had arrived after I had ordered it online. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.2\">It was the yogurt maker, which I had snagged for three thousand yen. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.3\">I read through the thin instruction manual and mastered usage of the machine, operating the apparatus by touch. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.223.4\">Then, after taking care of things that needed to be done, I went and bought the necessary items: yogurt and milk.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.224.1\">“Okay. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.224.2\">Let’s do this,” I said to myself.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.225.1\">I hadn’t thought too deeply about it before, but making yogurt was extremely simple. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.225.2\">First, you had to pour one hundred milliliters of milk out of a one-liter carton. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.225.3\">You could drink the one hundred milliliters you took out or you could use it in cooking. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.225.4\">In this case, I decided to just drink it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.225.5\">Then, you added one hundred grams of yogurt into the carton, which would have some empty space after you poured the one hundred milliliters out of it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.225.6\">Now that you had a ratio of nine to one in the carton (nine parts milk to one part yogurt), all that was left was to configure the yogurt maker.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.1\">The timer was set for nine hours: once that time was up, the entire contents of the carton would be turned into yogurt. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.2\">People might just say it would be simpler to go ahead and buy yogurt, but the true value of this device came into play when you used it a second time and onward. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.3\">Tomorrow morning, I could eat the one thousand grams of yogurt that would be made, but I’d leave one hundred grams in there. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.4\">By just buying new milk and adding it, it was possible to continue the growth process, using it as a starter for the next batch. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.226.5\">The power of lactobacilli.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.227.1\">Even if it were something I knew about in an academic sense, by actually making it for real, I could get a better feel for it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.227.2\">I’d only just turned the thing on, though, so I may have been overdramatizing it. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.1\">Anyway, I’d already said the best part about it, but if I could repeat this process forever, I wouldn’t have any worries at all. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.2\">Milk was fermented by the lactobacilli and turned into yogurt, but it was inevitable that the activity of the lactobacilli would weaken over time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.3\">As a result, the matrix of the yogurt would grow weaker. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.228.4\">There was the method of allowing for a longer period of fermentation time in order to get around this issue, but ultimately, the energy of the starter culture would be lost.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.1\">As long as I was going to be re-using cultures, even though I intended to be careful about sanitation, the activity of the lactobacilli would also be weakened due to certain things that couldn’t be avoided, like saprophytic bacteria floating in the air. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.2\">Even if I was being economical, I figured that I should stop using a culture after three times, four at most. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.3\">By making it myself and getting experience, I could get an intuitive feel for it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.229.4\">Enjoying this aspect was yet another pleasure of making your own yogurt.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.1\">I set the timer at just around nine o’clock at night. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.230.2\">It should be ready at six o’clock in the morning.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.231.1\">“Now then,” I said to myself, picking up my phone while it was still charging by my bed.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.232.1\">I had thought it was about time I gave Kei a call, but… Just as I was selecting Kei’s number from my call history, I received a call. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.232.2\">For a moment, I wondered if Kei had called me herself after losing her patience, but that didn’t seem to be the case.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.234.1\">“Oh, uh… G-good evening.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.235.1\">“This is unusual, I don’t often get a call from you, Satou.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.236.1\">I thought back to the Sports Festival last year, when we had exchanged contact information. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.236.2\">It’d been quite some time.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.237.1\">“Um, so, hey. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.237.2\">There’s something I really wanted to check with you, Ayanokouji-kun.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.238.1\">“What’s that?” </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.239.1\">“…It’s about Kei-chan.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.1\">It wasn’t hard to understand that Satou was concerned. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.2\">She was Kei’s best friend. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.240.3\">Perhaps her purpose for calling was to find out what I was feeling, without telling Kei.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.1\">“About Kei? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.2\">What about?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.241.3\">I decided to deliberately refrain from answering honestly, instead thinking I’d try hitting her with a single curveball.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.242.1\">“Well, you’ve been…fighting recently, right?”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.243.1\">“Is that

id=\"kobo.244.1\">“Well, kinda. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.244.2\">It’s like, part of it was me just, like, guessing, based on the flow of the conversation, though.”</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.245.1\">Perhaps Satou felt it would’ve been difficult to say that Kei had explicitly consulted with her about the matter, because she only said that she noticed something unnatural when she had been talking with her.</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"> </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.246.1\">“It’s almost the end of the year… You’re gonna make up with her

id=\"kobo.247.1\">Rather than doubting whether I was going to meet with Kei or not, Satou was more concerned about what was going to happen when we did meet. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.247.2\">She probably felt something very wrong was going on, and was worried for Kei. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.247.3\">She hadn’t been able to take into account things like the impact this phone call would have on Kei, but first, I wanted to appreciate the thoughtfulness of a close friend.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.248.1\">“Actually, I was just about to give Kei a call right now,” I told her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"
