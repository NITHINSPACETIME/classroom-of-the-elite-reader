class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.1.1\">“Then I might as well put you to work,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.2.1\">Sakayanagi took out her own phone and placed it on Kamuro’s desk with a light </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.3.1\">clak</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.4.1\">. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.4.2\">Displayed on the screen was Hashimoto, walking around Keyaki Mall with Ryuuen.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.5.1\">“You were in contact before this special exam,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.1\">“Ryuuen came up to me, though, not the other way around. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.2\">He basically forced me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.3\">Like, who even got me on camera, anyway? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.4\">Maybe it was your personal assistant, Yamamura, eh, Princess?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.1\">He didn’t even wait for Sakayanagi to say anything before rattling off questions as a deflection.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.1\">“Can we please put an end to this farce now?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.2\">asked Sakayanagi, her tone steady.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.1\">“No matter how much I try to explain myself, I can’t get you to believe me, huh?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.1\">“If you are going to continue to make excuses, can you show me your history on your phone?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.1\">“And will that convince you that I’m innocent?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.1\">“We shall see. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.2\">Do you not think that it is worth a try?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.3\">she replied.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.1\">“It’s true that if someone wanted to leak information during the exam, it’d be quick and easy to just keep a call going. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.2\">Or, messaging via chat or email on the sly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.3\">Which means that whoever has those logs would be the traitor. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.4\">Are you sure about this? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.5\">If you check my phone and don’t find anything, you’re gonna owe me a huge apology. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.6\">A massive apology.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.1\">“If I am mistaken, I will be sure to meet your expectations for an apology. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.2\">However, it is not your call history nor your chat history that I am requesting. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.3\">Those sorts of things can be easily erased, after all,” said Sakayanagi. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.4\">After the exam, Hashimoto had plenty of time to be alone. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.5\">Erasing those logs would’ve been no trouble whatsoever.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.1\">“Then what do you mean by ‘history’?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.1\">“Your Private Points.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.1\">Sakayanagi silently dared him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.2\">“</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.1\">Will you admit it now that I’ve said this much?”</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.1\"> Hashimoto’s voice got stuck in the back of his throat.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.1\">“Though you appear careless and sloppy, you are cautious. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.2\">Even if you were to work with Ryuuen-kun, there is no guarantee that he would not entrap you. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.3\">Supposing you were eliminated in the course of the exam, you would have run the risk of being expelled yourself. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.4\">You could have entered into a contract in the form of a written document to protect yourself, but that would leave behind physical evidence, which I am sure you wished to avoid. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.5\">It would not be surprising if a large number of Private Points were deposited in your account in lieu of a guarantee. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.6\">If he fulfilled his promise, you would fully refund him those points. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.7\">If he did not honor his promise, you would keep those Private Points. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.8\">In that case, you would not betray one another unless something went very wrong.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.1\">A wry smile appeared on Hashimoto’s face as he clutched his phone in his hands.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.1\">“…Dang. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.2\">Very clever. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.3\">All right, I give up, I surrender. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.4\">I admit it,” said Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.1\">Sakayanagi’s accusation had been correct. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.2\">Hashimoto had temporarily held onto a large number of Private Points that Ryuuen had collected from his classmates. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.3\">That was his insurance policy against being eliminated.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.1\">“How much did he buy you for?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.2\">asked Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.25.1\">“The price for the information wasn’t very high, honestly. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.25.2\">Just half a mil.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.1\">“That is quite a cheap price for betrayal,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.1\">“It seemed fair to me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.2\">I sure don’t mind having Private Points or anything, but that’s not the reason I did it.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.1\">Normally, this would’ve been the point where the detective pressed for a motive, but Sakayanagi didn’t do so. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.2\">She already understood the reason for his betrayal.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.1\">“I suppose I should applaud Ryuuen-kun for recruiting you,” she said.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.1\">“Don’t make me laugh. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.2\">I approached him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.3\">He’s not averse to acts of betrayal, and he’d accept it without hesitation if there was something in it for him. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.4\">Horikita and Ichinose wouldn’t have been able to do this, now would they?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.5\">replied Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.1\">“A traitor needs someone to cooperate and accept the information, I suppose. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.2\">He would be the only one who would readily agree to it,” reasoned Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.1\">“Yep. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.2\">I had a two-in-three chance,” said Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.33.1\">Hashimoto was saying that if Class A had been placed diagonally across from Ryuuen’s class on the organizational chart for the special exam and thus, they didn’t attack or defend, then his alliance wouldn’t have mattered and he would have played on the sidelines. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.33.2\">That alone would’ve made an enormous difference in this situation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.33.3\">The rankings for the special exam might have been the same as they had been in the first half.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.1\">“Aren’t ya thinking of reprimandin’ me? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.2\">Not even one little snippy comment?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.1\">“I am not a teacher. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.2\">It’s not my job to set you right.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.1\">Hashimoto shrugged and slipped his phone back into his pocket. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.2\">“Don’t ya think you should’ve at least frisked me or something?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.1\">“That would have been pointless. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.2\">I’m sure your phone was just a red herring, wasn’t it, Hashimoto-kun? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.3\">It is far too dangerous to conduct espionage with one’s own phone. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.4\">You must have borrowed a phone from a student in another class and hidden it somewhere in the classroom. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.5\">Isn’t that right?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.1\">“You got it all figured out, huh?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.1\">“There is no point in even trying to fool me,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.1\">Sakayanagi had quickly assessed the true situation and beat him at his own game. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.2\">If he had been suspected, he had planned to have turned over his own phone without hesitation, just as Sakayanagi had pointed out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.3\">Even if she had looked at every single person’s phone in class, she wouldn’t have found the traitor—it would have merely wasted precious time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.4\">Sakayanagi decided that she’d sooner just let him continue so she could make the best of it defensively. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.5\">There had been no need to instigate a panic.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.1\">“Your hiding places would have been limited to somewhere in the classroom, but it would take time and effort to find it, even if I had everyone searching. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.2\">Besides, if someone were to kick up a fuss during that time, pretending to be ignorant of the situation, saying, ‘Maybe the spy is in the hallway!’ </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.3\">before someone found the phone, it would be possible for that certain someone to eliminate the evidence,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.1\">Sakayanagi, whose legs were not very strong, couldn’t move nimbly enough to be able catch the culprit red-handed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.2\">If he saw Sakayanagi go and whisper into Kamuro or Kitou’s ear, he would’ve had plenty of time to destroy the evidence.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.1\">“When the students left after the special exam ended, you left the classroom with someone you are not particularly close to: Yoshida-kun. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.2\">Did you plant it in his bag?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.1\">“Daaamn. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.2\">Guess you were really keepin’ an eye on me, Princess. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.3\">Looks like I was your prime suspect all along.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.1\">“Your recent remarks were very suspicious.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.46.1\">“But why, though? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.46.2\">Why ask me to give myself up when you could have just said, ‘Show me your Private Point history’ the second I set foot in the classroom earlier and been done with it?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.1\">Sakayanagi had not immediately pressed Hashimoto for answers. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.2\">If Sakayanagi hadn’t known, this questioning would have been natural, but she’d been convinced from the start. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.48.1\">“Mercy for the traitor. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.48.2\">Including my silence during the exam,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.49.1\">She was giving him time to reflect on what he’d done and confess.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.50.1\">“It is a shame that you did not realize that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.50.2\">Contacting other classes, working for your own selfish benefit, plotting to transfer. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.50.3\">If it were only those things, I could overlook what you have done as careless. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.50.4\">However, in this case, your actions went beyond that.” </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span

id=\"kobo.98.1\">“…Why’s that?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.98.2\">asked Hashimoto.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.1\">“You are transparent. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.2\">You do not want to abandon a class in the lead, even if the future is uncertain. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.3\">But you are afraid of Ayanokouji-kun. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.4\">You wish to transfer classes, but there are no guarantees of what would happen after you transfer to Class B. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.5\">Even with a ticket, you wouldn’t go. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.99.6\">If you cannot move yourself, you have to move someone else,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.1\">Students who lacked commitment to a class wouldn’t be seen as trustworthy, and the hurdle in getting another ticket would be much, much higher. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.100.2\">Worst-case scenario, he’d be stuck on a sinking ship.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.1\">“Don’t worry, traitor, you will get your wish: you won’t be here for long. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.2\">You cannot escape now even if you wanted to, can you? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.3\">Negotiate all you want, wheedle, beg, but you’re not worth twenty million, Hashimoto-kun. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.4\">No one will seriously try to pick you up. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.5\">If you even try to acquire a Class Transfer Ticket, you won’t escape. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.101.6\">And, of course, I will never bring Ayanokouji-kun into my class either.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.1\">In other words, Hashimoto was completely boxed in. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.2\">But he didn’t shrink back from her anger. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.102.3\">From the moment he had decided to betray her, Hashimoto had been committed to this path.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.103.1\">“Well, I wanted you to listen to what I had to say, but I guess I’m outta luck. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.103.2\">I’m just gonna keep at it, then. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.103.3\">Gonna have to twist your arm to get Ayanokouji into our class, Princess.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.1\">This was Hashimoto’s big gamble. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.2\">If there were another chance for the class to oust one person, he’d be gone. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.104.3\">Without that opportunity, it’d be much more difficult.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.105.1\">“Special exams are not the only way to go about getting rid of you. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.105.2\">You understand that, yes?”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.106.1\">“You’re really determined not to listen, huh? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.106.2\">Well, it cuts both ways, y’know. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.106.3\">I can get you expelled, Princess. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.106.4\">Then I’ll take control of Class A and bring Ayanokouji into the class.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.107.1\">Sakayanagi applauded dryly in response to the final breakdown between them.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.108.1\">“Oh, well done. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.108.2\">What a luminary you are, Hashimoto-kun. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.108.3\">Go ahead. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.108.4\">Try to expel me. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.108.5\">I want to see you try.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.109.1\">A fault line opened between them that couldn’t be mended except by the others’ defeat.</span></span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",
