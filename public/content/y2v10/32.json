class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.1\">first attack in the second half of the exam, she shifted her sights from Horikita’s class to Ryuuen’s class, taking aim. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.2\">Prior to the special exam, she had no particular plan for fighting Ryuuen’s class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.6.3\">That was because she thought there wasn’t any need to formulate a meticulous strategy against an opponent whom she could easily crush in any situation, with any method.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.1\">As of right now, however, Sakayanagi had extraneous information floating around in her mind. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.2\">That was thanks to the phone call the night before from her classmate Hashimoto, who had given her some strongly worded advice. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.7.3\">There were a few things that firmly stuck in her mind, one of them being that she should explore the possibility of eliminating Shiina Hiyori and getting her expelled.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.1\">Sakayanagi wasn’t interested in things like Hashimoto’s opinions, but when she heard the reason, she changed her mind. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.2\">How Ayanokouji looked at Shiina, how he treated her. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.3\">Hashimoto said that he looked and treated her differently than he did with other, regular students. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.4\">That intrigued Sakayanagi. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.8.5\">She wondered, if she could get Shiina expelled from school, would Ayanokouji show any emotion?</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.9.1\">“But that’s no longer possible,” thought Sakayanagi aloud.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.1\">In the first half, Ichinose’s fighting style carried a stronger determination than ever. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.2\">In the past, she would have shown hesitation in eliminating students from an opponent’s class, even if it were Ryuuen’s. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.3\">However, when the fight began, Ichinose showed no hesitation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.4\">In the first half alone, she’d eliminated Ishizaki, Isoyama, Yano, and Morofuji. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.10.5\">She was solely looking out for her own class, showing no mercy to the others. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.1\">Even if Sakayanagi only targeted Shiina and successfully eliminated her, it would be one of the other students who would be sacrificed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.2\">Aiming for Shiina’s expulsion, an unlikely result, would be a sacrifice in efficiency. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.3\">Shiina had only made one mistake at this point. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.4\">Even if it were possible to hit her directly with problems she couldn’t solve, it would be difficult to do it twice before she’d be protected. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.11.5\">It wouldn’t be an easy move to pull off.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.12.1\">“Interesting…”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.1\">After taking first place in the first half of the exam, the game was growing tedious. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.2\">Perhaps it was time to have a little fun with it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.3\">She changed her decision—it would be interesting to add a little challenge by getting rid of a specific target. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.4\">After clearing that difficult hurdle, she would then naturally keep the lead and stroll to the finish line. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.5\">So then, how to formulate a strategy to achieve this? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.13.6\">In the few minutes she had before her turn came, she formulated a strategy. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.1\">Then, finally, her turn came. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.14.2\">However…</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.1\">On turn eleven, all five people Sakayanagi had nominated had been saved via protection. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.2\">She had spent two points on her attack, and she absolutely needed that swing to hit. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.3\">But what happened was the complete opposite of what she expected. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.15.4\">One after another, the students in her class said things like “They just had a good round—don’t worry about it.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.16.1\">Sakayanagi was not so convinced of that.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.1\">It was just one perfect score. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.2\">However, it was too perfect; it couldn’t have been luck. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.3\">She immediately nixed her self-imposed challenge of taking out Shiina. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.4\">Abandoning all strategy and theory, she went ahead and chose at random. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.17.5\">It was a combination of categories and nominations that nobody could predict. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.1\">The results were the same as turn eleven: perfect. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.18.2\">Ryuuen had pulled off two consecutive miracles.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.1\">Her classmates couldn’t hide their bewilderment. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.2\">It wouldn’t be surprising if the first thing they imagined was that they were losing strategically—perhaps their moves had been anticipated. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.3\">That wasn’t even a possibility in Sakayanagi’s mind. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.4\">Someone was up to something. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.19.5\">In just those two turns, she was convinced of the only possible answer: there was a Judas in the class—a traitor.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.1\">It had to be a leak. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.2\">There could be no other explanation. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.3\">Sakayanagi decided to silently observe the students in her class until her next turn came. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.4\">Some students exchanged looks and lamented Ryuuen’s good luck. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.5\">Others were glued to their phones, trying not to be eliminated. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.6\">Eventually, the thirteenth turn came. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.20.7\">The class naturally fell silent.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.1\">Sakayanagi was also silent. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.2\">She waited thirty seconds, then a minute. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.3\">It wasn’t as though she were racking her brain to figure out a way to get around Ryuuen’s defenses. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.4\">This silence was a nonverbal command from Sakayanagi to her classmates. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.21.5\">She beamed out her intention: </span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.22.1\">“You’re playing with fire, and it stops here.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.23.1\">After maintaining the silence until the last possible second, Sakayanagi gave her nominations to Chabashira-sensei. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.24.1\">Once again, however, Ryuuen’s score was perfect.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.25.1\">“How unfortunate,” Sakayanagi muttered softly to herself, her smile fading.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.1\">As the information was leaking in real time, the methods by which the traitor was doing this were limited. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.2\">One method would be via chat or email. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.3\">But as students were busily studying, merely typing wasn’t suspicious. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.4\">The next possible method was to say the names vocally, via telephone or other means. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.5\">As soon as Sakayanagi notified the teacher of her nominations, that information could be immediately transmitted to her opponent. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.26.6\">The traitor wouldn’t even have to touch their phone.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.1\">Sakayanagi could ask the teacher for permission to submit her nominations on paper, as a precautionary measure. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.2\">If that weren’t possible, she could switch to a plan that involved whispering her nominations into the teacher’s ear. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.27.3\">However…</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.1\">Sakayanagi directed her gaze at the large monitor displayed behind the teacher’s back. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.2\">Even if Sakayanagi prevented audio leaks, there was no guarantee that the problem would be solved if the traitor used a cell phone camera. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.3\">Was her only hope of defense to physically prevent information from being sent? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.4\">She could have everyone stop using their phones and tablets. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.5\">Then, she could employ a method of whispering her nominations into the teacher’s ear and have everyone in her class turn around and have their backs to her until Ryuuen finished inputting his five nominations, thereby shutting out all information. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.6\">If that solved the problem, then that would be a satisfactory outcome. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.7\">She would be able to stop Ryuuen’s rampage after only giving him fifteen points. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.28.8\">As Sakayanagi continued to think, a voice reached her ears.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.29.1\">“There’s a leak.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.30.1\">Morishita Ai had broken the silence, muttering those words dully with a blank expression. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.1\">“You may be right, Morishita-san. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.2\">I think we should have everyone stop using their phones to check. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.3\">There is a possibility that Ryuuen-kun has a scheme,” said Sanada, speaking up after a slight delay to agree with Morishita. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.31.4\">It was an appeal to Sakayanagi to act.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.32.1\">Kitou and Hashimoto stood up immediately.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.33.1\">“There is no need for that,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.1\">“B-but…!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.34.2\">protested Sanada.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.35.1\">“You should all continue to use your phones to prepare,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.1\">While in the middle of this confusion, it was difficult to say whether continuing to study would be effective. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.36.2\">They had received an unexpected order from their leader: to refrain from the required course of action.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.1\">“You sure, Princess? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.2\">After seeing him get three perfect rounds in a row, I’m positive that’s what’s happening. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.3\">No matter how you slice it, I think info is being leaked. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.37.4\">We need to do some—”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.1\">“I’m not altering course. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.38.2\">We will continue with the exam as-is,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.1\">She’d shut them down. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.39.2\">No one had the authority to overturn her decision, yet her classmates wondered why Sakayanagi wasn’t doing what needed to be done.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.1\">Betraying one’s class wasn’t easy. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.2\">If your opponent was blatantly getting all their protections right, then it would only be a matter of time before you realized there was a leak. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.40.3\">If the traitor knew this and was still doing it, Sakayanagi was concerned that the problem wouldn’t be solved simply by taking away her classmates’ phones and blocking their view of the screen.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.1\">What would happen if measures were taken, but the information leakage didn’t stop? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.2\">Sakayanagi expected that it would lead to a loss of access to information, leaving her classmates confused and bewildered. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.3\">Even if evidence of the traitor did show up, Sakayanagi reasoned that if she were in the traitor’s position, she would not keep any evidence on her person. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.4\">The traitor could plant it in a random student’s desk, in someone’s bag, or elsewhere in the classroom. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.41.5\">If that happened, it’d just end up turning into an endless argument.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.1\">Students would probably start trying to pin the blame on each other, arguing, “It’s not me!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.2\">“Well, it’s not me, either!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.3\">back and forth. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.4\">Naming a suspect would only lead to turmoil. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.5\">In any case, the more noise she made now, the more she had to lose. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.6\">Sakayanagi decided that avoiding coming in last place should be a higher priority than taking first. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.42.7\">Even if the information leakage continued, it would not affect her ability to defend and score points.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.1\">Sakayanagi tried to parry Horikita’s attacks as much as possible and aim for third place, but it was futile. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.2\">Based on how the exam was going and from what was shown on the monitor, it was also apparent that Ichinose was assisting Horikita. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.3\">A strategy had been formulated to force Class A into last place. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.4\">They continued to be at a disadvantage in the second half, and once the twentieth turn was over, they decisively failed. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.43.5\">They ended up six points shy of third place.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.44.1\">“I’ve lost,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.1\">The four classes were competing against one another, and then Sakayanagi made a blunder, taking last place. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.2\">Even if the situation was the result of a betrayal from within, she could make no excuse. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.3\">Sakayanagi let out a small sigh. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.45.4\">As the leader it was her responsibility to accept failure.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.46.1\">“Now that we have suffered defeat, I must choose someone to expel out of those who have been eliminated,” announced Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.47.1\">The five students who had been eliminated over the course of the exam were Kamuro, Yamamura, Sugio, Toba, and Machida.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.48.1\">“The logical choice would be to make a decision based purely on your level of contribution to the class. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.48.2\">I will not be doing that. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.48.3\">From my perspective, you five are all at the same level,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.49.1\">“W-well, in that case, how are you going to decide…?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.49.2\">asked Machida, one of the eliminated students.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.50.1\">“Shall we have the students draw lots? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.50.2\">It would be fair,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.51.1\">The proposal, which the students hadn’t even considered, elicited shrieks of terror from the eliminated.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.1\">“Have I disappointed you? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.52.2\">Unfortunately, the most disappointed party won’t be around long to express it,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.1\">Through the silence, Sakayanagi quietly proceeded. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.2\">Those who had been eliminated wanted to air their grievances, but they also didn’t want to make a bad impression on Sakayanagi and have her seal their fate. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.53.3\">That was the outcome they most wanted to avoid.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.1\">“It is pointless to raise objections. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.54.2\">The leader has the authority to decide who will be expelled,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.1\">“How the hell can you say a lottery is a decision?!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.55.2\">argued one student.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.56.1\">“It’s obvious. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.56.2\">Think of it as a situation where a student with low OAA scores accepts the responsibility for it and is expelled. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.56.3\">I have decided to judge that the unlucky one in this scenario is that student with no ability. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.56.4\">Also, the first student to declare that they will not be participating in this drawing will in effect be stating that they have forfeited, and that person will be the one I will get rid of</span></span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Properties__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"

Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.59.1\">Sakayanagi solemnly cut off their escape route and forced them into participating.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.60.1\">“I made the lots for the drawing,” a female student, not reading the heavy feeling in the classroom, called out to Sakayanagi in a laid-back tone of voice.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.1\">“You are very quick in your preparations, Morishita-san. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.2\">Moreover, thank you for anticipating our needs. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.3\">In that case, I will spare no time. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.4\">Shall we get this over with? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.61.5\">I regret to inform you that whoever draws the slip of paper with color on it will be expelled,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.62.1\">There were five lots prepared in total. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.62.2\">Four out of five were safe.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.63.1\">“Who will draw first? </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.63.2\">The odds will not change whether you draw first or last,” announced Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.64.1\">They could either try to avoid expulsion by their own action or wait for someone else to be expelled. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.64.2\">Machida, while suppressing his urge to refuse, took the initiative and drew his lot.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.1\">“Yeaaaah!” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.65.2\">he exclaimed.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.1\">Machida drew a blank slip of paper and gave the biggest fist pump he’d ever given. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.2\">Spurred on by this, Sugio and Toba followed in turn. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.3\">One by one, they drew their lots, but the slip with color at the end wasn’t drawn. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.4\">Only two remained: Kamuro Masumi and Yamamura Miki. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.5\">The former had only been holding back because she felt like this was all too much of a hassle. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.6\">The latter was too scared to move. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.7\">Their reasons for hesitating couldn’t have been more different. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.8\">Though the remaining two had been in her crew, and far more than the three who were saved earlier, Sakayanagi’s face didn’t change a shade. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.66.9\">She’d already decided it didn’t matter who was gone.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.67.1\">“You can draw yours first,” said Kamuro.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.1\">Even though Kamuro urged her to go ahead, Yamamura didn’t move. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.2\">She was shuddering at the thought that there was a one-in-two chance that she could be expelled. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.3\">Her heart wasn’t prepared for it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.4\">She couldn’t even think about what would happen after getting kicked out of school. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.68.5\">Her legs were paralyzed.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.69.1\">“I-I, I, um…” stammered Yamamura.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.1\">“Of for the love of… Fine, I’ll go draw then. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.2\">You happy?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.70.3\">snapped Kamuro.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.71.1\">Yamamura couldn’t get words out. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.71.2\">Just nodding her head repeatedly in affirmation was all she could do. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.71.3\">Kamuro walked up to Morishita, the person who was holding onto the lots.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.72.1\">“Please wait.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.73.1\">Just before Kamuro reached out with her hand, Sakayanagi told her to wait.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.1\">“I had said earlier that those who do not draw lots will be expelled. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.74.2\">Yamamura-san, who has refused to draw, is now gone,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

id=\"kobo.79.1\">“No, I am not. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.79.2\">I am simply stating the facts of the matter,” said Sakayanagi.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.80.1\">“Oh, okay, sure. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.80.2\">If Yamamura and I draw out lots at the same time, problem solved, right?” </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.80.3\">said Kamuro.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.81.1\">Sakayanagi had tried to hastily settle the decision of who would be expelled, but Kamuro put a stop to it. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.81.2\">She had calmly tossed aside the opportunity to avoid her own expulsion.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.82.1\">“Come on. </span><span

class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\"><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.83.1\">Kamuro walked over to Yamamura, who was unable to take even a single step

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.84.1\">“All right, this is our first and last chance to see who is luckier, me or you,” said Kamuro.</span></span></p>\r\n<p

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.88.1\">Morishita presented the two lots. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\"

Yamamura reflexively grabbed one of the lots. </span><span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"koboSpan\" id=\"kobo.88.4\">After making sure that she took one, Kamuro grabbed the
