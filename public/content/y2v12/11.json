Besides, I don’t think it’s that unusual to have two emotions running in parallel. Despite how it looks, I have quite a few friends. Friends from elementary school and junior high, friends I met in high school and college, and friends I came to know when I became a working adult. However, Sae-chan’s the only person with whom I have an ongoing relationship, with whom I can talk honestly, about how I really feel. I don’t know exactly what she thinks about it, though.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">Even if I lose to someone else, I cannot lose to Sae-chan. The days that we spent together in the same class, aiming for Class A together, instilled such feelings in me. Originally, Sae-chan did not want to be a teacher. But that day, the day that we were made to understand that we wouldn’t be able to graduate from Class A, I knew for certain that Sae-chan wanted to become a teacher to try to go for Class A in a different way. That’s why I decided to aim to become a teacher too.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">Frankly, this profession is a far cry from what I wanted to do. Day after day, I get made fun of and treated with contempt by arrogant students, and I can’t expect much of a paycheck either. Even so, I still became a teacher.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">I have only one goal: to keep Sae-chan from getting any hope of achieving her goal of graduating from Class A.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">I mean, it’s obvious why, right?</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">That day, we couldn’t graduate from Class A anymore because of Sae-chan’s trivial romance. Had it not been for that, I wouldn’t have become a teacher and would have led a more glamorous life. And yet, Sae-chan is the only one to get her students to graduate from Class A?</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">And like that, she just squares up her past, with a sense of self-satisfaction?</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">I can’t allow that.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">Not when I’m still held prisoner by the past, even now.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">So, as long as my eyes are on her, I will never let her win.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">If my class loses in the End-of-Year Special Exam…</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">If Sae-chan’s class ends up becoming Class A, then…</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">In the worst-case scenario, I will have to do whatever it takes to put a stop to it.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">I don’t care if I’m branded as an unfit teacher.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">I don’t even mind if I’m ousted from my teaching position.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">I am definitely going to put a stop to it, even if I have to force my way through, to take her down with me.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">That’s what I had vowed to myself, deep down.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">The special exam for the end of the second year will begin soon.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">Depending on whether we win or lose this time, the fate of my class, which has been pushed to the brink, will be decided.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">For both me and my students, an important battle that we absolutely cannot lose is about to begin.</span></p>\n",
