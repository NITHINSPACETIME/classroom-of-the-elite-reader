  "content": "\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\" id=\"auto_bookmark_toc_17\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">Now, there would be a ten-minute interval before Katsuragi’s next opponent would appear.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“I guess she managed to get here,” thought Katsuragi aloud.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">The next person to come through the door was Sakayanagi Arisu, who was serving as the general for Class A. When they had first started at this school, they were classmates and competed with one another over the position of leader. Things were not going to go the same way that they did with Sanada and Kitou. Katsuragi was prepared for that. Now, finally, the time that Katsuragi had been anxiously awaiting had come.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“I am astonished that you defeated my vanguard and center while losing only one Life Point,” commented Sakayanagi as she entered the room. She showed no signs of even the slightest agitation.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“Selecting Kitou as a representative out of everyone was a clear mistake,” remarked Katsuragi.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“It was his wish, as he wanted to deal with Ryuuen-kun directly. Besides, in this special examination, there is no problem as long as the general is not defeated. I had determined that regardless of whatever form the special exam took, there would be no problem even if I threw away my first two pieces. That is all,” said Sakayanagi.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“And such self-conceited pride on your part may lead to your defeat,” countered Katsuragi.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“Heh heh. First of all, please allow me to compliment you. I am seeing you in a slightly more positive light now, Katsuragi-kun,” said Sakayanagi.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">Even though Katsuragi was the only student with experience in two different classes, Sakayanagi hadn’t expected Katsuragi would defeat Sanada and Kitou quite so quickly and easily. Such results were the only reason that she was paying him a compliment. In response, Katsuragi solemnly put what had been brewing in his mind into words.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“I’ve been working vigorously for this day—to get my revenge against you and strike you down,” said Katsuragi.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“Revenge? I see. You are referring to Totsuka Yahiko-kun, whom I had driven to expulsion, yes?”</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">Katsuragi clenched his fists tightly as they rested in his lap. That was his answer.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“If I were still the old me, it would have likely been difficult for me to grasp your feelings, Katsuragi-kun. But now, I understand a little. Perhaps I should have used a different method to select whom to have expelled,” said Sakayanagi.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“Come off it. Are you trying to tell me that you have changed your worldview?” said Katsuragi.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“You can interpret that as you like. It is fine that you are angry, but your vengeance will not be carried out. Now that I am here, things will no longer go your way,” said Sakayanagi.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">Katsuragi acknowledged Sakayanagi’s abilities as well, begrudgingly, given his past history of being ousted from the position of leader during his time in Class A. There was no doubt that the format for this particular End-of-Year Special Exam was one that Sakayanagi excelled in. Moreover, Katsuragi was at a disadvantage in terms of Life Points, with his six to her ten. Even so, Katsuragi took his seat with the intention of doing whatever might be necessary to take down his opponent, willing to take a hit if it meant her downfall.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\">“Now then, the next discussion will begin.”</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">Both representatives closed their mouths once the announcement was made, and they straightened their posture once more. The battle of Katsuragi vs. Sakayanagi was starting.</span></p>\n",
