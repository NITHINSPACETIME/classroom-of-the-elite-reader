Although you have grown over the past two years at this school, you will never be able to overcome that wall. You are tyrannical, savage—you can make full use of those such abilities, but such things are mere child’s play to Ayanokouji-kun. He can fight without hesitation even in your area of expertise,” said Sakayanagi. </span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“Then what’re ya tellin’ me to do, exactly?” asked Ryuuen.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“I am saying that you must change your way of thinking, that you must learn to think more flexibly,” she replied. “It is nearly impossible to defeat Ayanokouji Kiyotaka-kun, who is close to absolute perfection. Not only with a frontal attack of course, but even outlandish schemes will not work. Which is why I will specifically create a weak point within him.”</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“You sayin’ you’re his weak point?” asked Ryuuen.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“Yes. This may help you someday. No matter how superior an intellect he possesses—no, actually, it is precisely because he possesses such superior intellect that it leads to unexpected weaknesses,” said Sakayanagi.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">Ryuuen was getting this advice because Sakayanagi wanted to, in her own way, get back at Ayanokouji for being mean to her. She was convinced that she could control Ayanokouji’s thinking, just as he had controlled the outcome of their match by using a message that no one but a genius like her could’ve understood. Ryuuen, for his part, was choking back ridiculous, absurd feelings, like </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman__And__Italic\">“Sakayanagi’s better at that than me…” </span><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">He could feel the words there in the back of his throat, clawing to get out, but this time he forcefully swallowed them back down. </span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“It is a good thing to continue being lost for a while. If you do not give up, you will find a way,” said Sakayanagi.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“You two just go off and talk like ya can see into other people’s heads. You and Ayanokouji,” spat Ryuuen.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“That is the greatest possible compliment,” replied Sakayanagi, chuckling and poking at the ground with her cane. “Well, then, shall we wrap things up here? I have some other plans to attend to.”</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">Ryuuen realized that they had been absorbed in conversation for quite some time. Most likely, this would probably be his last conversation with Sakayanagi.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“So, what’re you gonna do when you get outta here?” asked Ryuuen.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“I have been told which school Masumi-san has transferred to. I intend to visit her there first and offer her an apology while I am there,” Sakayanagi answered.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“She’s gonna be freaked out when you show up,” said Ryuuen.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“Well, knowing her, I suppose the first thing to come out of her mouth will be a sigh.” With that said, Sakayanagi began walking away. “Let us meet again another time. Until then, please do not get yourself expelled from school in a disgraceful manner.”</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">Ryuuen had always had an adversarial relationship with Sakayanagi. Not just with her, but with anyone. Now, however, he felt assailed by an indescribable feeling of loss. Things had changed significantly not only because of the End-of-Year Special Exam, but because he had recognition from Sakayanagi. Perhaps it was because he had lost someone who could possibly be called a rival. From now on, Ryuuen would have to stand alone against Ayanokouji. Ryuuen never once looked back, not until he could no longer feel Sakayanagi’s presence. However, it was then that a new, single question came to mind.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“Huh?” he blinked and suddenly turned around, but there was already no sign of Sakayanagi anywhere. “…‘Another time’? There ain’t no ‘another time’ for you. What, you bein’ a sore loser?” </span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">However, he cast that thought out of his mind, since there was no point in thinking about someone who was leaving the school. He was still himself, and first, he was going to set his sights toward the upcoming battle in his third year. Now that Sakayanagi was gone, he had to focus on his fight with Ayanokouji, even if he didn’t want to. Although Ryuuen had returned to the competitive stage after getting a large number of Class Points, things like the point totals were nothing but fluff right now.</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">The road to Class A would stay closed unless Ayanokouji was defeated. Ryuuen’s doubts had not completely disappeared, but even so, the fog had lifted thanks in part to the little goddess who didn’t know how to take it easy on others. She told him to accept the fact that he was no match for Ayanokouji as he currently was, at least for the moment. </span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">“One year. Just one year, huh?” Ryuuen mused. “Ha! Bring it on.”</span></p>\n\n  <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span class=\"C_Current__And__Times_New_Roman\">For Ryuuen Kakeru, the most important single year of his life was about to begin.</span></p>\n",
