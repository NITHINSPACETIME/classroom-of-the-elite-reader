Syougo Kinugasa here. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">To update you on what’s been going on in my life, I had the atheroma that’s been growing in my back for the last ten years (and got to be about seven centimeters in diameter) surgically removed. I’m glad to be rid of it, but, well…I couldn’t lie on my back for a whole week. At least I’m healing up nicely.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The anime adaptation is out there now. Did you all enjoy it? I was deeply moved to see my story brought to life in a way only animation can achieve. There’s been a huge increase in the number of people reading </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Classroom of the Elite </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">since the anime came out, and I’m exceedingly grateful—especially for those of you who read the books before they were adapted. Your support allows us to keep publishing these books. Thank you all very much.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ayanokouji seems to have settled things with Ryuuen for the time being, but that’s not necessarily the end of Class C. The third semester will be a brand-new stage, involving not only the student council, but the second- and third-year students, too. Class A and Class B will be facing off, and previously minor characters will take the spotlight more often. In the near future, you’ll see Ichinose and Sakayanagi’s stories, as well as Katsuragi, Hirata, and others. Who will become enemies? Who will become allies? Pay close attention, and find out.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Meanwhile, I’m hard at work on the Volume 7.5, a compilation of short stories about the events of winter vacation. They’ll center on Christmas, and the main story will focus on the girl featured on the next cover, and her romantic endeavors. I say “short stories”, but really, Volumes 4.5 and 7.5 are books in their own right, bridging the gaps in the main story by covering the times classes aren’t in session, such as spring and summer break. Please keep that in mind as you read. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">And, as always, thank you very much for your continued support.</span></p>\r\n",
