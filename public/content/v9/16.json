You see so many restaurants\r\n            in the media—I thought maybe I should go eat at one of them myself. But there’s probably\r\n            been more than a few occasions when a place is shown on TV, and right after, becomes\r\n            so popular that you can’t even get in. Even worse, the prices get way too steep…</span></p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Oh, hey there. It’s been a while. It’s the guy who felt like Volume 8 had only just\r\n            been released yesterday, but now realizes we’re already at the release of Volume 9:\r\n            Kinugasa. </span></p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I just can’t help but feel concerned about my health these days. Because of the nature\r\n            of my occupation, I spend almost two-thirds of my day sitting down. My blood circulation\r\n            is getting worse and worse and my back is hurting more. When I was young, I could\r\n            push through somehow, thanks to my physical prowess. But now I can’t really fake it\r\n            to get by anymore. I’ve been going in for regular checkups and everything, but I kind\r\n            of feel like…you know, as long as there’s no way to really address the root of the\r\n            problem, the future doesn’t hold much hope.</span></p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Anyway, the story of Volume 9 focuses on Valentine’s Day and the time leading up to\r\n            the year-end exam. The protagonist has gradually started to become surrounded by more\r\n            and more girls. I’ve been wondering if there’s a chance that he might actually make\r\n            some progress with a girl, deepen his relationship with her, in his second year of\r\n            school.</span></p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The story also focused on Ichinose, who hadn’t really had much time in the spotlight\r\n            so far in the series. There were no special exams this time around, so the story unfolded\r\n            in a relatively peaceful (?) way, but it’s getting to be more serious. </span></p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Finally, the first-year arc will come to an end with the special exam featured in\r\n            the next installment, Volume 10. There have been times where I’ve thought to myself…\r\n            “They’re still in their first year, even though it’s been close to </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">four</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> years since the series started?” So, from here on out, things may start to develop\r\n            a little bit faster…maybe. (I still don’t know yet.)</span></p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The words my editor said to me at the time I started this series are still in my mind,\r\n            even now.</span></p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">“I’m glad that this is a work where time always moves forward.”</span></p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">No matter how long it takes, the end will eventually come. I laughed at first when\r\n            I heard that, but now I’m convinced it’s true. I have a pretty serious look on my\r\n            face as I think about it now. I’m thinking I’d like to show you how the class points\r\n            and the main character’s private points are coming along in the next volume, if possible.</span></p>\r\n      \r\n      <p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Anyway. Let’s meet again in Volume 10, everyone.</span></p>\r\n      \r\n   ",
