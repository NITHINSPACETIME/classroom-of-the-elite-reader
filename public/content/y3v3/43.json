Neither Class A nor Class B made any significant moves and just like that, it was time for the 3:00 PM update.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The commander contacted Shiraishi and the additional designated areas were announced.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Upon hearing that, Hashimoto and Kanzaki exchanged a glance and then both looked over at me almost simultaneously.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Looks like the situation&apos;s finally changed, huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Up until now, the designated areas had been shrinking inward from the map&apos;s outer perimeter, one row at a time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That pattern was broken for the first time. Rows 4 and 5 and columns K and L all became designated areas. In other words, the remaining area was now shifted slightly southwest of the center.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Class A, which had been staying in F5, would likely now have to hurry toward G8.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And it seemed highly likely that Class B would stay put, not panicking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If they moved carelessly toward the center, they would also run the risk of being caught in a pincer attack.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">One could say Class B&apos;s fate depended on whether they regretted not acting sooner, or if they had another plan and remained unfazed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;re inside the area and getting too close to the center is kinda sketchy, y&apos;know? If it&apos;s the same as yesterday, the area probably won&apos;t shrink at the 5 PM event, so is waiting and seeing the right move here?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto muttered, map in hand, saying that was what he would do.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;However, waiting right on the edge of the designated area has its own risks. If we&apos;re ambushed ahead of us during the next update, our escape route will be completely cut off.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I get what you&apos;re saying, Kanzaki, but are you suggesting we move forward one whole area? Honestly, a ten-minute time difference is practically nothing.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We can secure a better position if we move now. If we move to H10, it will be easier to flexibly move in any direction&#x2014;north, south, east, or west.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kanzaki pointed with his index finger, indicating that a spot south of the center of the remaining area would be ideal.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But won&apos;t that make it easier for other classes to attack us? What do you think, Ayanokouji?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t say for certain, but considering how the designated area expanded from the northeast this time, the probability of the mountain being left is extremely low. Moving a little closer now would be the better option. H10 isn&apos;t a bad choice.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Moving carelessly too far north or west would only increase the chances of attracting other classes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Our new destination was a short move to the north. As for supplies, they had appeared at our newly designated destination, H10 and also at J12, so we decided on a policy to retrieve them from just those two locations.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Form a retrieval squad and send a small group to J12. In the meantime, the rest of us will move to H10. It will probably be our last destination for today.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The third day was entering its latter half, but we decided to continue observing Class A&apos;s and Class B&apos;s movements.</p>",
