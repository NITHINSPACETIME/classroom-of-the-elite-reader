There&apos;s a possibility your allies are hiding nearby.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nah, that ain&apos;t it. You guys are always watchin&apos; the GPS, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If your commander is using tactics, that&apos;s not necessarily the case, as you should be well aware.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nah, you can only fake out the whole GPS or an individual&apos;s GPS, one or the other, y&apos;know? There&apos;s no way to freeze the GPS of only the people other than us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;However, it is possible to target up to three people individually.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The possibility that we had three allies use the individual GPS jamming tactic to outsmart them and lie in wait behind us, or somewhere nearby, couldn&apos;t be denied.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What Class D was wary of were three invisible, armed enemies.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While it might not have been enough to overturn a situation where they were at an overwhelming disadvantage, it could be called the only way to inflict major damage.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Just three people ain&apos;t gonna do nothin&apos;.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you were to jam the entire GPS right this instant, it would no longer be limited to three people. Am I wrong?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Fair point.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kanzaki declared to Hashimoto that there were any number of ways to deceive Class D.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But in reality, we have no desire to fight Class D. First, let us talk.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There&apos;s no need for that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Saying that, Kanzaki approached us, his gun still raised.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It seems you were caught in a surprise attack by Ryuuen and lost the morning battle as well.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So you got a good look at our pathetic state, huh.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If we defeat the two of you here, we can significantly lower our chances of coming in last. This is a golden opportunity.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That might be true if you&apos;re only looking at this special exam. However, even if you defeat us, there&apos;s no guarantee you can beat Class A and Class B. Your goal isn&apos;t to avoid last place, but to aim for the top. Surely you understand that much without Ichinose having to tell you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although they&apos;d been wounded by Koenji, it remained doubtful just how much of an advantage Class D could gain against Class B, who already had combat experience, with numbers alone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let&apos;s join forces. That way, Class C and Class D can form a group of fifty.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;An alliance... What if we trust you and are betrayed? That would be a crisis for our class.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although he wore a stern expression, I didn&apos;t get a strong sense of hostility from Kanzaki.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s why I refuse&#x2014;or rather, it&apos;s not that I don&apos;t feel like saying that and sending you away... but I can trust you, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The atmosphere changed. It was a reaction as if he already understood everything about why we came.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ichinose, their commander, had likely already given them some sort of message.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Right now, we need Class D&apos;s help. And we believe we can be the strength that Class D needs.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As soon as I answered, Kanzaki lowered the gun he&apos;d been holding.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if on cue, the boys standing behind him all lowered their guns at once.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You can bring your allies. As you wish, let&apos;s talk first.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m grateful we didn&apos;t get shot, but... you&apos;re being awfully reasonable, aren&apos;t ya?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto, whose imagination hadn&apos;t yet reached the behind-the-scenes interactions between Ichinose and Class D, suspected this might be a trap to lure us in.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ichinose told us that Class C might make contact at some point. She also warned us not to make the first move until we were attacked.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, what do you know&#x2014; You&apos;re sayin&apos; Ichinose saw it comin&apos; that we&apos;d ask for your help?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I also heard about the alliance. Considering that, a request for cooperation is hardly a stretch.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He shifted his gaze from Hashimoto to me, so I gave a slight nod.</p>",
