Having lost the direct confrontation with Class B, we immediately began moving east. Our goal was to make contact with Class D, who were gathered at M10. Meanwhile, after watching us move, Ryuuen&apos;s class split back into three groups and began to move out to secure the large number of supplies spread across the southern area.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Koenji, who launched a surprise attack, had been wandering around B8 and B9 alone since noon. He might have been enjoying a carefree swim in the ocean.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a fortunate development for Class C that supply crates with ammunition appeared at K12 and L13. Since there were supplies we could easily secure during our retreat, we were able to collect them safely.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, at 3:00 PM, the third event of the day was announced and on the analysts&apos; tablets, another outer ring of squares was colored gray.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As most expected, it seemed the usable area was shrinking in a circular pattern.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In response, an hour later, Class A made a new move. Having been scouting a wide area in the north, they began to converge on the center of F and G, preparing to escape to a safe zone in advance of the 5:00 PM event or the new restricted areas that would appear on the following day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Meanwhile, Class D was also wary of the outer restricted areas expanding. Seeming to have concluded that heading north was too risky, they hastily began to return to the center through N13 and N14. At that rate, we would soon run into them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We all stopped for one last confirmation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto spoke to the students who still looked somewhat uneasy or dissatisfied.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;re lucky Ayanokouji brought up the idea of an alliance. If no one had even mentioned the word &apos;alliance&apos; at this point, there&apos;s no way one would&apos;ve been formed during this special exam.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With Ichinose, there was a good chance she would&apos;ve considered and formed an alliance even in a tight spot, but Hashimoto didn&apos;t let on anything of the sort. He hyped up the fact that I&apos;d formed an alliance as a golden opportunity. However, there were likely still parts the other students couldn&apos;t believe.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is this for real? What if they just decide to finish us off while we&apos;re wounded?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t you worry about that. Ayanokouji&apos;ll handle the talks. But we&apos;re in an overwhelmingly weak position. We&apos;ll probably have to accept whatever demands Class D makes, though.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As the ones being helped, most of my classmates had no choice but to swallow it and move on.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Well, to be honest, there are still parts I&apos;m not entirely convinced about. But our class isn&apos;t exactly good at these kinds of exams, to put it nicely. I was worried about how well we&apos;d be able to hold our own against people like Ryuuen and Sudou. Instead of getting stuck in third or fourth, making an alliance or whatever to take second place... I guess I can&apos;t say it&apos;s a bad thing... but...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, it still meant giving up on first place, so it wasn&apos;t something to be unconditionally happy about.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Still, if we could walk away with second place from that point, it was more than enough as a compromise.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If we concede the win&#x2014;even if we concede it, will Ichinose really follow through in the next special exam?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I decided it would be better for me to explain that point instead of Hashimoto, so I interjected.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you&apos;ve seen the kind of student Ichinose is, you should understand that she can be trusted. Besides, they have no merit in betraying us just because we let Class D win this exam. It&apos;s not like taking first place one time will get them to Class A. If they were to carelessly throw away our alliance, the backlash would be greater than you can imagine. The collapse of a class that&apos;s been built on trust would be inevitable.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was why, I explained, there was no way they would unilaterally terminate the alliance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...I see.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In exchange for the appeal of the reward decreasing, the risk of placing in the lower ranks was reduced.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And if the goal was to make the current Class A and Class B take those lower spots, it wasn&apos;t a bad plan at all. In the short term, we&apos;d be saddled with the Class D title, but what was more important was closing the gap with the upper classes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Class C and Class D form an alliance and take first and second place. If you can guarantee that outcome and those rankings you&apos;re talking about, we&apos;ll accept the alliance on positive terms. Are we good with that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s enough.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Pragmatism over empty gestures. Whether we were in an alliance or not, the most important priority was ensuring our own victory.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My classmates considered and accepted that fact in a very short amount of time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The color returned slightly to the faces of the students who&apos;d grown pale after losing the battle with Class B.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">On the other hand, you could never really know people. It was Hashimoto who&apos;d taken it upon himself to persuade our classmates about the alliance, but he seemed unable to completely shake his own doubts.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The moment everyone looked away, he approached me and spoke in a low voice to confirm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re sure this is gonna be okay, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s wrong? Are you worried about the alliance after all?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I gave him a probing look, he averted his gaze with an awkward expression.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Nah, forget I said that. It&apos;s your plan and you&apos;re the one who said you&apos;d drop out if we lose. What choice do I have but to believe you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Given that he was the type to start from a place of doubt, Hashimoto&apos;s reaction was understandable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t mind. In fact, actively speaking your mind is a benefit to me, not a detriment. If you have any concerns, feel free to voice them or consult with me whenever you like.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh, really? Well, I appreciate you sayin&apos; that, but...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We continued to walk after that, taking breaks in between, for another thirty minutes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as we neared the border of L13 and M13, a report came from the commander that the positions of Class C and Class D were just a stone&apos;s throw away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;ll wait here for now. I&apos;ll go talk to them by myself first.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I handed my weapon to Matoba. Hashimoto, as if confirming his resolve, followed suit and handed over his own.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, the sound of running came through and he immediately stood beside me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m going too and don&apos;t try to stop me, alright? If they start shootin&apos; without askin&apos; questions, I can be your shield. If you, the leader, survive, we&apos;ll still have a chance to win, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I suppose I&apos;ll gratefully accept your sentiment.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If Ichinose intended to betray and defeat me, she would do it after pretending to be an ally and luring in all of Class C. It was highly unlikely she would open fire at this stage.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, there was no need to dismiss Hashimoto&apos;s spirit and determination, so I permitted him to accompany me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So now we&apos;ve got no way to fight back, huh. If they shoot, it&apos;s all over for us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It would be the same even if we had our weapons. Standing up to them would be futile against their overwhelming numbers.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...That&apos;s true.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With our concerned classmates watching from behind, we started walking toward Class D&apos;s standby point.</p>",
