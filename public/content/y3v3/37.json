It would be difficult for them to open up right away. In some cases, their wariness might not fade until the exam ended; I myself anticipated as much, but that prediction was soon overturned in a good way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The unique characteristic of Class D. The trust Ichinose cultivated. Towards the members of Class C, who were unable to readily reach out, the Class D students actively spoke to them, treating them no differently than they would during their usual school life.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And they even encouraged active mingling between students who didn&apos;t usually have strong connections.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In a situation where it would&apos;ve been perfectly normal for Class D, with their numerical advantage in the special exam, to try and take the lead, they treated them as equals. That opened the closed-off hearts of Class C and rapidly lowered their guard.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, complete trust couldn&apos;t be formed immediately. However, there was no doubt that they made an impression strong enough to make one think that if they were to be betrayed by Class D, then it couldn&apos;t be helped.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The charm Class D possesses is incredible.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiraishi, too, seemed to be one of those impressed by the sight.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m surprised, too. It&apos;s a strength that can&apos;t be seen from class rankings or test scores alone.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;To maintain an alliance, both sides must be equal. It would never work if the powerful party tried to dominate from above, if one side became too subservient, or if mutual suspicion were allowed to spread. With Class A or Class B, it would&apos;ve been impossible from the start.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&#x201c;The information that Classes C and D may have formed an alliance in this special exam, based on GPS movements, has likely been reported from the commanders to the VIPs and shared by now. At this stage, it&apos;s become difficult to oppose the combined force of the C-D alliance, which is now the largest group.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But we couldn&apos;t let our guard down for a moment. If anything, we had to become even more vigilant.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How do you think the top two classes will assess this situation and act from here on out?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If I&apos;m just stating my wishful thinking, I&apos;d want them to crush each other somewhere that doesn&apos;t involve us. Even though our alliance has the numerical advantage, if either of them challenged us, more than half of us would be eliminated. If that happens, the remaining class can aim for victory by taking advantage of the conflict.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, the same could be said from any class&apos;s perspective.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Naturally, making the first move wouldn&apos;t be easy.</p>",
