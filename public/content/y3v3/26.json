I was watchin&apos; the whole time on the analyst&apos;s tablet and saw you reach the event and secure the goods. Heard you went straight for the destination, huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I actually had to search for a bit. It helped that it was placed in a surprisingly easy-to-find spot. Inside the supply crate were five small mess tins, five small bags of white rice to go with them, five 500-ml bottles of water and five small, simple loaves of bread.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For a class maintaining a group of nearly forty people, these were meager provisions. It symbolized how a single event wasn&apos;t enough and how we had to keep moving.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So it&apos;s not much, huh? Sorry, but we pulled back without a second thought. A big group was comin&apos; our way. Guess you could say we succeeded in drawin&apos; &apos;em out, though.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having fewer people was a disadvantage not only in terms of points, but also in combat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But if there was one advantage to be found among the many drawbacks, that was it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The Class C students began to assemble the tents and make their beds.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The tents that could sleep three or more people were for the boys, while the smaller one- and two-person tents were mainly for the girls and to keep things fair, we used rock-paper-scissors to assign who would use which tent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The girls are settin&apos; up the simple tents and makeshift toilets now and they&apos;re pretty damn good at it. I mean, for Japanese high schoolers, we&apos;re probably top-class when it comes to roughin&apos; it in the wild, huh? I thought it was a useless experience at first, but it might actually be a handy skill.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto said with admiration and he was right.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In a disaster-prone country like Japan, it&apos;s not a bad thing to have experience with things like living in a tent and using outdoor toilets. No, in fact, it&apos;s probably one of the things that should be encouraged from now on.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was the third year and the third time we had an uninhabited island exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed that holding them consecutively had been rare until now, but when considered as an important experience for the future, it wasn&apos;t hard to see why.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In the future, if we were ever caught in a situation where electricity wasn&apos;t readily available, wouldn&apos;t we be able to handle it without panicking?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A short while later, once the setup was more or less complete, we gathered the food we&apos;d brought back in one place and began to calculate how much each person would get if we divided it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, we would collect as much as we could from future events as well, but it was always better to keep track of our current caloric intake and hydration levels.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was to avoid heading to an event when we didn&apos;t need to gather excess supplies, which could lead to unnecessary confrontations and casualties.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Furthermore, to maintain fairness, the food we obtained was distributed equally among everyone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And so, while commiserating over the day&apos;s fatigue, the students brought the modest meal to their lips.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey, can I ask you somethin&apos;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Matoba, who&apos;d approached me, said so hesitantly while looking at the food.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How effective is it, really, to eat and drink in small portions? It&apos;s not like we&apos;re light on luggage and food takes up a lotta space, right? Wouldn&apos;t it be better to just eat when we can?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;As an extreme example, the energy efficiency of splitting one meal into three is overwhelmingly higher than stuffing yourself with one meal a day. The human body is limited in how much energy it can store when consumed all at once. Carbohydrates are a good example; even if a small amount is stored in the liver and muscles, the rest is converted into fat. Of course, energy is also consumed during the conversion process. Water is even more pronounced; drink too much and it can&apos;t be stored, instead being expelled as sweat or urine. Moreover, the human body adapts to starvation and transitioning gradually to a low-calorie state slows the metabolism and suppresses consumption.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even in survival manuals for disasters, the basic principle was to consume small amounts for as long as possible.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So, even with the same food, how long it lasts is completely different.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Matoba understood that even if it was a bit of a hassle, it was definitely better to carry the food.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After that, the students who finished their meal enjoyed their free time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A few students came forward saying they wanted to practice shooting for tomorrow, so I gave them permission after limiting the number of bullets they could use.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As long as they didn&apos;t shoot others, firing a gun outside the designated times wasn&apos;t, in itself, a violation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If anything, it was important for them to hone their skills.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I spread out the map and reflected on the day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Class C, half-destroyed in a surprise attack; Class B, which was all but unscathed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Class A and Class D succeeded in keeping a firm distance from the other classes, navigating the events safely and only collecting supplies.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The effect of sinking to a provisional last place was significant and few of my classmates were smiling.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Man, everyone&apos;s lookin&apos; so gloomy. Well, can&apos;t be helped, given our results so far.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto muttered as he looked around, a nutritional block held in his mouth.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Isn&apos;t there somethin&apos; you can say as our leader? Like, &apos;We&apos;ll definitely win, so don&apos;t worry,&apos; or whatever.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t say something baseless. If I were to say that now, I&apos;d only earn their resentment and they&apos;d ask, &apos;Who do you think you are?&apos;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The leader who couldn&apos;t foresee the surprise attack and was nonchalantly lecturing on how to use the weapons.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was perfectly obvious that I would be met with looks and words of contempt.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And yet, you seem to be havin&apos; a pretty good time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do I look that way?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Just a hunch. How can you enjoy a situation like this?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I suppose it&apos;s because I don&apos;t dislike the deserted island exam itself. It&apos;s an intense way to experience things you could never go through in a normal school life. I get to see so many expressions on my classmates&apos; faces that I&apos;ve never seen before.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, that&apos;s somethin&apos; else. So you&apos;re sayin&apos; you&apos;re satisfied in a way that&apos;s got nothin&apos; to do with whether we&apos;re winning or losing the exam?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It would be a lie to say I&apos;m not. Of course, I have no intention of losing, either.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ll take you at your word. Anyway, I guess when things are this gloomy is when it&apos;s my time to shine, huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With those words, Hashimoto clapped his hands and made his way toward his downcast classmates.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not like we&apos;ve lost the exam yet, y&apos;know. If you get all down in the dumps, we&apos;ll lose a battle we could&apos;ve won, don&apos;tcha think? How &apos;bout you try to have a little fun with this deserted island life?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whether he was encouraging them or provoking them, Hashimoto continued on.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;d be one thing if we were in the lead, but do you really think we can enjoy ourselves while we&apos;re losing?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For Class C, who weren&apos;t used to losing, the defeat in the end-of-year special exam, the previous loss by a narrow margin and now this difficult situation was a series of misfortunes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The human brain receives roughly twice the emotional impact from a loss as it does from a win. They were a class that&apos;d won many times before, but that, combined with their current position as Class C, was becoming an unbearable shock. Because they were nearly the polar opposite of Horikita&apos;s class, their state was, after all, very interesting to just watch.</p>",
