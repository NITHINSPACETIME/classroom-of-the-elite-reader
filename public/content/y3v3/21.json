I&apos;ll inform Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s group right away.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ending the call with Shimazaki, Shiraishi lowered the radio and quietly raised her head.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The GPS of everyone in Class B was just updated significantly. It appears that many of them have moved from the C11 area where they were originally located and are now concentrated in F10.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This made it clear that the effect of their tactic had worn off and it could be said that the risk of them lurking nearby had also been significantly reduced.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Also, the three who strayed have all been eliminated. Unfortunately, it seems they headed toward the vicinity of F10 and were taken down.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Can&apos;t be helped, I guess... Without the VIP, you can&apos;t tell what&apos;s goin&apos; on. Hey, but what do you mean, &apos;concentrated in F10&apos;? That doesn&apos;t mean everyone, right? Give me the details.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Unflustered by Hashimoto&apos;s prodding, Shiraishi traced a thin, white fingertip along the unfolded map.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;As I mentioned, the blue GPS signals&#x2014;that is, the people believed to be Class B&apos;s main force&#x2014;are gathered here in F10. However, another ten blue GPS signals have also moved to the area one-southeast of here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ten people? Is a detached unit comin&apos; after us?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, I wonder about that. If we reason it out normally, there&apos;s a possibility that one or two students followed us on impulse, like Kondou and the VIP and their guards accompanied them to pick them up. The large number is likely due to their concern that the commander would use a tactic to identify the individuals.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I agree with Ayanokouji Kiyotaka&apos;s reasoning. If just one or two of them were to carelessly go and pick up the stragglers, it would be like proving they were the VIP.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So that&apos;s the most likely scenario, huh. But we can&apos;t let our guard down yet, can we? They can only use the group-wide GPS once, but they can use the individual GPS stop three times, right? There&apos;s still a chance they&apos;ve followed us this close&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s unlikely. It was a successful operation because it combined two things: a surprise attack and a group-wide attack, strategy and firepower. Even if they used their three chances to fake the GPS locations of three people, they wouldn&apos;t have a follow-up. Without moving the VIP, it&apos;s also difficult for them to grasp our precise location.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...I see. So that means we can finally relax, huh.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even Hashimoto, who&apos;d been shouting and barely escaped the storm of paintballs with his life, looked utterly exhausted. Everyone, including Shiraishi&apos;s group, sank powerlessly to the ground.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Eighteen people were left. The expression &quot;half-decimated&quot; was a perfect fit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Two VIPs, one analyst and fifteen guards.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From there, Rokkaku became the analyst to fill Nakajima&apos;s place, leaving fourteen guards. The scout position was also vacant, but for now, we prioritized the number of guards and put that on hold. We were put in a difficult situation where we couldn&apos;t afford to clash head-on with other classes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was my misjudgment to stop for so long, thinking the enemy wouldn&apos;t attack once we had put some distance between us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A situation brought about by none other than the carelessness and arrogance of the Class C leader.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a battle that would make anyone, both inside and outside the class, think that way.</p>",
