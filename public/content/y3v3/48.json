The time was 12:00 PM.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Horikita and the others temporarily stopped to receive a new report from Matsushita.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It seems a Class C student was just eliminated between E12 and F11. The remaining student appears to be turning back, but... what in the world could this mean?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Upon receiving the bewildered report from Wang, Horikita and Hirata looked at each other.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Did they try to retrieve the supplies at F10 without using a VIP? And then Class B ambushed them when they strayed a little from the path?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...I don&apos;t know. But there&apos;s no doubt that Ayanokouji-kun is the one giving the orders. Tell Matsushita-san to immediately use a tactic to find out who the retreating student is.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Y-Yes!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Wang received Horikita&apos;s instructions and immediately relayed them to the commander via radio.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Not even a minute later, another message came in from Matsushita, who used the tactic, to Wang.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The retreating student is Nishi-san from Class C and her role is Scout!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A Scout... In that case, we can likely rule out the possibility that they were after supplies...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Could it be that they used two people as bait to lure out Class B? No, but that would be a rather ineffective way to go about it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;They&apos;ve just pointlessly lost a guard. And there&apos;s no guarantee the scout will even make it back safely. Their true intentions are still unclear, but for now, let&apos;s monitor the movements of both classes from here. While securing a location that&apos;s easy to defend in case we&apos;re attacked.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ten minutes later Horikita and the others noticed something was wrong.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It became clear when communication came in immediately from Matsushita to their VIP, Wang.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Horikita-san! Class C and Class D have apparently started moving north! To be precise, all their GPS signals are moving northwest from H10 toward G9!&quot; Kushida, who was standing right near Horikita, spread out a map and Horikita peered down at it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For them to move to G9 at this stage... doesn&apos;t that mean there&apos;s a chance they&apos;re targeting us?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Yes. Well, if they&apos;re trying to take someone down, it&apos;s only natural they&apos;d target Class A over Class B&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A-And there&apos;s one more thing to report! Class B, which had been on standby in E12, has also started to move north!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Both classes started moving five minutes earlier, with what seemed like perfectly coordinated timing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No way... Could it be that Class D contacted Class B for this very reason...!?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s possible. They might&apos;ve proposed a pincer attack to take down Class A.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With Kushida calmly analyzing beside her, Horikita immediately relayed it to her classmates.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;W-w-w-what&apos;re we gonna do!? There&apos;s no way we can win against three classes!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If they are coming for us, staying here just means we&apos;ll get caught in a pincer. I think running is an option, don&apos;t you? There&apos;s a chance they&apos;ll run into each other in the meantime.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She was forced to make a decision, even though it wasn&apos;t certain that they were targeting Class A.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2014;We&apos;re moving. Let&apos;s fight Class B at E10.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter how advantageous their defensive position was, that advantage would be blown away in an instant if they engaged with three classes. She judged that challenging Class B to a fight gave them a higher chance of victory.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Everyone hurriedly shouldered their bags again and immediately began to advance toward E10.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The next GPS update confirmed that Class B entered E11 and the allied classes were about to enter G9. Class A continued toward E10, but ten minutes and two GPS updates later, the situation began to change again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As a result of the other classes realizing they&apos;d begun to move five minutes earlier, Class B stopped their northward advance and began to retreat back the way they came, toward E12. Meanwhile, Class C and D stopped moving north and began to move west.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;They must have sensed we were trying for a swift conclusion and pulled back. But I was fully aware they&apos;d notice. We&apos;ll proceed to challenge Class B to a fight.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As the words left her mouth, a sickening feeling clung to her. It was because she was enveloped in a sensation of being swept away by a raging current that allowed no resistance. The Class C student sent towards Class B. If they conveyed the message to cooperate and defeat Class A, fully prepared to be eliminated, then the entire development involving all four classes was none other than a scenario orchestrated by Ayanokouji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her ideal had been to stand her ground and observe until the very end. And yet, starting with a single raid from Ayanokouji, she allowed him to manipulate the state of the battle with such ease.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This is Class A&apos;s weak point, Horikita-san. I&apos;m sure you were prepared from the start for the risk that others with the shared goal of pulling down the top class would team up.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Yes, you&apos;re right. For us, from here on out&#x2014;this is where we show what we&apos;re made of.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Horikita acted, believing it would lead them down the path to their own victory.</p>",
