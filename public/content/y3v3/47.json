I got the report yesterday that you were out right at the very end and I got nervous for a second, but then I heard you were safe because it was after six? Man, you really do some crazy shit.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Despite his words, Hashimoto was smiling from start to finish and looked incredibly pleased.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This guy&apos;s been all worked up ever since he found out you took out a few Class A students and even made them attack you after exam hours. He&apos;s been obnoxiously bragging about it this whole time, you know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Looking exasperated, Takemoto said, &#x201c;Good work,&#x201d; and lightly placed a hand on my shoulder.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course I&apos;m pumped! I was thinkin&apos; there was no way you&apos;d escape from the middle of enemy territory and now here you are right in front of me... You really are something else, man.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We kept losing points in the beginning. I&apos;m glad I could make up for it, even just a little.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;More than enough. Well, the only real bummer is that we couldn&apos;t get the VIP, I guess.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;About that. I want to give out instructions right away.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Flanked by Takemoto and Hashimoto, I started back toward the main group where Kanzaki and the others were waiting.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What kind of instructions?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After hearing the instructions, Hashimoto and Kanzaki exchanged a glance and though surprised, they immediately began selecting the people needed to carry it out.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was grateful that they got their heads working before they even asked about the true meaning of my instructions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t say it there, but there was something I came to understand from infiltrating Class A.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was that Class A was slightly lacking the tension it should&apos;ve had.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was likely because Horikita reassured her classmates early on by publicly declaring she would use her Protection Point to protect the class if they lost. On the other hand, Ryuuen&apos;s class was probably different. Even though Kaneda had a Protection Point, everyone was fighting desperately.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That seemed to be linked to their so-called higher motivation, one of the factors that would decide the outcome.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shortly after, I regrouped with everyone and selected the students to send toward Class B. However, as the risk was extremely high this time, we didn&apos;t take the VIP. We sent out only two people: one student who was prepared to be sacrificed and one scout. And then, the rest of us waited for that time, 11 a.m.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The remaining survival area announced on the analyst&apos;s tablet was a 5x5 grid from D8 to H12.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And the provisions that appeared were at D12, E8, F10, G9 and H12.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But that wasn&apos;t the only important point. Although the restricted areas had been announced little by little with each new event cycle, on the final day, all of them were announced at once.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At 1 p.m., it would be the 16 squares from D9 to G12. At 3 p.m., it would shrink drastically to just four usable squares from D11 to E12. At 3:30 p.m., E11 and E12. And at 4 p.m. the exam would end&#x2014;it looked to be a fierce battle in an area so narrow that with only two zones left, it would be practically impossible to survive without getting out. Moreover, the grace period for staying in a restricted area was no longer one hour, but came with the grand bonus of a forced expulsion after an accumulated 60 seconds if you stepped into one after 3 p.m.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Damn, this is crazy... If we leave even one of their guards standing, we could get wiped out...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto grumbled that it was by no means enough space or time to get away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But deciding they should focus on the immediate task, he shook his head once and continued.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Only five spots and other than E8, the four left are all food, they say. We can for sure get the one at H12.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Looking at the situation, I decided what to do and gave my orders to the entire group through Hashimoto and Kanzaki.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2014;I will now explain the strategy.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In response, the expressions of the students, including those from Class D, all tensed up at once.</p>",
