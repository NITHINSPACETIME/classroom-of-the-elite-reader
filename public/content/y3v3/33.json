I had my classmates take a rest while I went a short distance away to talk with Shiraishi and Hashimoto.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As it happened, Yamamura was there by herself and she tried to leave when we approached, but when I told her it was fine for her to stay, she gave a hesitant nod.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It seems we&apos;re not being followed. I believe we can rest easy for now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;re totally screwed... It&apos;s like, I really felt the strength of the side that just waits. Or rather, they just have more guys who are genuinely better at survival games than we are.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While there was a big difference between attacking and defending, Hashimoto muttered his honest impression from the firefight with a hint of surrender.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To be honest, I didn&apos;t think there was a huge difference in skill itself, but Class B&apos;s fighting spirit and intensity were far superior. It was proof that Ryuuen&apos;s high-pressure morale and orders were working in their favor.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve just received one piece of good news.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiraishi, who continued to communicate via radio even after confirming Class B wasn&apos;t in pursuit, cut in during a lull in the conversation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Apparently, the GPS signals for the ten Class B students who went to E9 have all been eliminated, save for one.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Huh? The hell? What&apos;s that supposed to mean?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It appears to be the result of their route completely overlapping with Koenji-kun&apos;s GPS.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re not serious. He took out nine guys all by himself?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The situation would suggest so. It&apos;s hard to say if he listened to Horikita&apos;s instructions or if it was just a whim. Given how things have played out, the latter seems more likely.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Heh, if that&apos;s the case, we&apos;ve turned a disaster into a blessing. That bastard Ryuuen must&apos;ve taken some serious damage.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto spoke cheerfully. It was true that this was likely an unforeseen battle for Ryuuen. The recent fight against Class C had an ideal outcome of six to one or two, but behind the scenes, he lost nine people. This was damage that couldn&apos;t be ignored.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Still, we struggled just to take out one or two people and Koenji goes and solos nine? What a hell of a trade that turned out to be.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Koenji-kun has not been eliminated and is apparently still staying in E9 alone.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He took out nine people and still managed to survive without being eliminated?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;An unexpected outcome. Still, there&apos;s a big gap between Class C and Class B.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I knew he was the type to swat down an annoying fly if it buzzed in front of his face, but it seemed he made contact and engaged them in a small area. The result appeared to be a more overwhelming victory for Koenji than I&apos;d imagined, but it was unclear if it would motivate him. In fact, it seemed entirely possible he might just be satisfied and call it quits.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, I couldn&apos;t be as genuinely happy as Hashimoto and the others about Koenji defeating nine people.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At first glance, it seemed like only a good thing for the other classes, but there was the matter of balance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was fifty-fifty on which way I wanted things to turn out, but it looked like I needed to give it some thought.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As Hashimoto, Shiraishi and I were talking, Matoba, who&apos;d been fighting on the front lines, walked over, his expression one of utter exhaustion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Can I talk to you for a minute?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you&apos;re gonna blame Ayanokouji for this situation, give me a break, man. He&apos;s doin&apos; his best while we&apos;re half-destroyed as it is.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I know. That&apos;s why I want to continue our talk from yesterday... no, the one we cut short.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The one we cut short?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I tilted my head slightly, not understanding what he meant, Matoba spoke hesitantly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s... about the alliance with Class D.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We can take our time and discuss that matter after this exam is over. Even if I get expelled, the deal won&apos;t fall through, so don&apos;t worry.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No... it&apos;s because we&apos;re in this situation that I want to talk about it now. You probably think this is self-serving, but I understood it clearly in that last fight. We can&apos;t push back and what&apos;s more, we can barely even move. It&apos;s a certainty that the area will shrink from here on out and Class A or Class D might come to finish us off while we&apos;re weak. There&apos;s just no way I can see us surviving.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having fought them head-on, perhaps his spirit had been broken by Class B&apos;s aggressive stance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s frustrating, but I can&apos;t deny it. I&apos;m trying my best to win for real, but there&apos;s no guarantee we can turn this disadvantage around.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I know. That&apos;s why I&apos;m asking if we can make the alliance... official, right here and now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;An alliance?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, if Class D will have us, I want to join up with them right away. I thought that would be for the best. If the alliance is formed, we&apos;ll have a huge force of about fifty people. We could make a full recovery, not just some kind of rally, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if it was their only option, he cast aside his pride and opened the lid he himself closed, making his appeal.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto reacted immediately, patting Matoba on the shoulder.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nah, I was thinking the same thing. I&apos;ve already told the class about the alliance talks and the C and D alliance is gonna be exposed soon anyway, right? It might be a little earlier than planned, but I think it&apos;s the best way to protect ourselves.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While he followed my instructions, he would likely welcome any plan that was safer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A brief silence fell as everyone held their breath, waiting for my answer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s my fault things got this bad; I let my guard down. But it&apos;s true that because we left the possibility of an alliance open, it might just be our last hope. Matoba, if you and the rest of our classmates can agree to it, then it&apos;s worth taking that bet.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as Matoba nodded, Hashimoto clapped his hands together with a <em>smack</em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ll talk to the other guys. You cool with that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, I&apos;m counting on you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Alright. Leave it to me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Thumbs-up and looking pleased, Hashimoto ran over to his battered and bruised classmates.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yamamura watched the exchange without saying a single word.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, she looked at me hesitantly, as if she had something she wanted to say.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What is it? If you have something on your mind, say it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah, no, it&apos;s just... you accepted Matoba-kun&apos;s... reproposed alliance so readily... I was just thinking... I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Was that wrong?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;N-No, of course, I also felt that merging with Class D was one of the best choices to protect our class now that we&apos;ve been cornered this badly. It&apos;s just... if this was going to happen, I can&apos;t help but wonder if it might have been better to discuss the alliance again much sooner... Morishita-san might not have been eliminated and...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed Yamamura was thinking that I, of all people, could have tried to bring up the alliance again after we were ambushed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I was told to drop any talk of an alliance, so I couldn&apos;t bring it up.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Right, of course... I&apos;m sorry for saying something so strange.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even after hearing my answer, far from looking relieved, an even deeper shadow fell over Yamamura&apos;s expression.</p>",
