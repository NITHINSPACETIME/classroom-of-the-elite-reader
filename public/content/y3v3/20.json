In contrast, for the other three colors&#x2014;red, blue and yellow&#x2014;tapping them only brought up a blank tag.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, since it was possible to freely enter text into these tags, one could input a name if they knew who the GPS belonged to, or a role if their position was discovered. It could also be used to mark students who were making suspicious moves.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She looked away from the tablet for a moment, placed it on the simple table set up in front of her tent and took the radio in one hand and started to walk slowly around the headquarters area.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She did that to check who the commanders of each class were and what they were up to.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">During the exam, the commanders were bound by an unexpectedly troublesome restriction.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They were forbidden from talking to or communicating with the other commanders.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if she wanted to contact Ayanokouji, actions like calling out to Shimazaki to ask him to pass on a message were impossible.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Furthermore, there was a physical distance between the tents, making it difficult to overhear the voices of the other class commanders speaking normally. If one were to force their way closer, there was a risk of being perceived as attempting to communicate, so they couldn&apos;t approach carelessly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And this didn&apos;t just apply to interactions with other commanders.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I guess it&apos;s impossible after all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The commanders were forbidden from leaving the designated headquarters area and from within that area, it was structured in such a way that they couldn&apos;t make contact with the students participating in the exam, no matter how hard they tried.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if students made their way to the headquarters, direct conversations with a commander wasn&apos;t possible.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In other words, they had to convey their voice to their own class&apos;s VIP through the radio.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was the only way commanders were permitted to intervene with others.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was why, in the opening stage, they reported the information from their tablets every five minutes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To see if there was a risk of an enemy class engaging with them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since that was what they needed to confirm, it could be said to be a natural course of action.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As Ichinose watched the similar exchanges between the three from a distance, she noticed something.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kaneda, the commander of Class B, was the only one who was constantly talking into his radio.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He also touched his tablet without a moment&apos;s rest, as if he were in a hurry for something.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If that had been all, Ichinose wouldn&apos;t have grown so suspicious, but despite the situation, Kaneda looked up just once and spotted Ichinose observing him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A calm, normal face, as if to say, <em>&apos;What is it?&apos;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When Ichinose smiled and gave a small wave, Kaneda gave a slight nod with just his head before immediately returning his gaze to the tablet and resuming his conversation with the VIP on the radio.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A natural response. But to Ichinose, it seemed unnatural.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ichinose slowly returned to her tent and once she was out of Kaneda&apos;s sight, she picked up the tablet she had left on the table.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The place where Ryuuen-kun and the others are hasn&apos;t changed much from five minutes ago. Hmm, they haven&apos;t moved at all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was safe to assume there would always be some margin of error with the satellite signal due to the basic limitations of GPS.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In other words, even if everyone was sitting perfectly still, it wouldn&apos;t be strange for at least one of them to move slightly. However, she could see no difference whatsoever between their positions five minutes ago, as she remembered them and their current positions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Has Kaneda-kun already stopped the GPS? If so... why?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The answer to that was obvious, even without Ichinose having to ask herself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was because he judged that using his trump card, the GPS shutdown right at the start of the exam would be effective enough.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A plan to attack Class C, who were located closest and were the most likely to have stopped moving.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, the possibility wasn&apos;t a certainty, but it was better to warn them of the danger just in case.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Thinking this, Ichinose hurriedly moved to a position where Shimazaki could see her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Speaking, gesturing, or even mouthing words would be a strict violation of the rules, so Ichinose wouldn&apos;t and couldn&apos;t risk it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But she decided that the act of just staring at Shimazaki probably wouldn&apos;t fall under the category of communication. If she received a warning, she would just have to back down then.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If they made eye contact, he might realize that she was trying to tell him something.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, Shimazaki&apos;s attention was focused on operating his tablet and he didn&apos;t look up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For a minute, then two, Ichinose continued to stand there, waiting for Shimazaki to look up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Finally, just as five minutes were about to pass, he looked up and lightly rolled his neck as if to loosen his stiff muscles. His eyes met Ichinose&apos;s for a moment, but that was all. Shimazaki immediately dropped his gaze back to his tablet.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From his perspective, Ichinose was an enemy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And he was also keenly aware of the rule that forbade any communication.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s... no good.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no way for Ichinose to warn Class C of the danger any further.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Believing that interfering too much risked a penalty for Class D and that it would be even more dangerous to stay too long and draw Kaneda&apos;s attention, Ichinose reluctantly distanced herself from the area and returned to her own tent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Over the radio, she spoke with Class D&apos;s Kobashi, firmly emphasizing their safety and instructing them to avoid combat on the first day to focus only on events, also relaying a few possible routes in case other classes pursued them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Five minutes later, the GPS updated again. Ayanokouji&apos;s Class C&apos;s GPS was active, but their position was fixed; they were perhaps resting or having a strategy meeting. In any case, they were not moving. Meanwhile, the GPS for Ryuuen&apos;s class was also completely stationary.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;As I thought... Given the time, they might be reaching Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s group right about now...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">An anomaly that Ayanokouji would have surely noticed had he been the commander.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The frustration of sensing it but being unable to tell the other class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ichinose prayed for Class C&apos;s safety.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What Class B was trying to exploit was a weakness in Class C.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She understood well that in this special exam, the brain and the body were separate.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ichinose was impressed, judging that the decision to take them by surprise was the correct one if Shimazaki was the commander.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Being caught by surprise might have been unavoidable, but even so, Ayanokouji would not be completely wiped out.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If so, Ichinose considered what would happen next.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If they suffered a devastating blow, Class C would be forced into a difficult fight.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What, then, would Ayanokouji do?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ichinose instantly judged that this was the best moment to bring up talk of an alliance and picked up her radio.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2014;-I want you to listen to me very carefully.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">So from that point on, Class D could rush in at any time to help Class C&#x2014;no, to help Ayanokouji.</p>",
