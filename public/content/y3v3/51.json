As of now, there are a total of 43 students remaining. As for the breakdown by class&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiraishi calmly explained the situation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Just as you said, Ayanokouji-kun, it&apos;s turned into quite a chaotic battle, hasn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Appoint a commander, gather supplies, keep your distance, read the enemy&apos;s movements and avoid engagement. Then, devise a strategy in preparation for the final decisive battle. They can carry things out reasonably well up to this point, but once the firefight actually starts, anyone would lose their ability to think calmly. What&apos;s more, without their VIP nearby, they can&apos;t even tell their own precise location, let alone the enemy&apos;s. Should they go right or left, forward or back? While they&apos;re wandering, they run into other classes, creating a chain of eliminations. The ones fighting right now aren&apos;t trained soldiers or even people who have played this survival game over and over. They&apos;re just a bunch of high school students.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The important thing was to throw the field into intense chaos. To sow discord and reduce their numbers.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Once a little more time passed, the numbers would decrease further. And at that time, the action to take was already decided: have the VIP escape. They had no choice but to avoid total annihilation and switch to running until time ran out.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was the same for Horikita and Ryuuen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It appears Kanzaki-kun and the two Class D VIPs have now arrived at G11. The suspension of the global GPS will be lifted shortly. Will the pursuers move immediately to target the three of them after this?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Fifty-fifty. The battlefield has already expanded and it&apos;s not certain if the VIPs who&apos;ve noticed will be able to give information to their guards. Either way, if there&apos;s any suspicious movement, we&apos;ll use our tactics to get them away immediately. Just as planned.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Understood.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As I nodded, Shiraishi took the radio and told Shimazaki to prepare to use the individual GPS shutdown tactic. The targets weren&apos;t the Class C VIP, but the two Class D VIPs who were currently escaping. There was no restriction that a tactic had to be used on one&apos;s own class, so as long as it wasn&apos;t a problem in and of itself, no issues would arise from using it on anyone from any class. However, only the commander of the class that executed the tactic would know their current location, so that point alone required caution.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What was important was not letting anyone figure out where the escaped Class D VIPs were.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Just now, another one from Class A, Yukimura-kun&#x2014;the second VIP&#x2014;was eliminated. That means the only one left is Satou-san, correct?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I imagine Class A is surprised right about now. Wondering why their three VIPs were found out and are being so persistently targeted. And by all three classes, no less.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The one big mistake Class A made before the final day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was the evening of the third day, when I showed up at Horikita and the others&apos; campsite.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At the time, I arrived while the GPS suspension was still active and I didn&apos;t attack right away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I attacked only after carefully checking the positions of my former classmates.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The objective wasn&apos;t to eliminate as many people as possible, but to find out who the VIPs were.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having received an unexpected attack, the Class A students&apos; thoughts would&apos;ve been split into two main camps: &apos;defeat the intruder&apos; and &apos;protect the VIP&apos;.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Defeat if the VIPs were all eliminated and the maneuvers to protect them. It was an action that&apos;d become ingrained in them over several days of having it drilled into their heads. The guards immediately ran to protect the three.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Those three were Wang Mei-Yu, Satou Maya and Teruhiko Yukimura.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Didn&apos;t you ever suspect it might have been a fake?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If they could have predicted the attack beforehand, it could&#x2019;ve been a feint. But the attack came when they thought the danger was over for the day. The probability of it being an act is low.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And so, I decided to give the information I&apos;d obtained to Class B this morning as well.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was because it would be easier for them to fight if they knew who the VIPs were.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If they chose not to believe the information, there would be no negative repercussions, so it was information they had nothing to lose by receiving.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, if even a small number of students approached Class B carelessly, they would be shot.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In fact, the student I sent was shot and eliminated, but that was no problem.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even after being eliminated, as long as it wasn&apos;t during a battle, some conversation was possible.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That would be effective in defeating Class A and that information would also act as the catalyst to get Class B to attack Class A.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So, they were skillfully outplayed by you alone, Ayanokouji-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I think Class A&apos;s movements weren&apos;t bad, considering they knew they were a target. Now, all that&apos;s left is to take out the remaining Class B students and this special exam will be over.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if capable students like Sudou or Hirata remained, they couldn&apos;t continue to operate if the VIP was defeated.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Excuse me, there&apos;s a message from Shimazaki-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiraishi&apos;s expression stiffened slightly as she listened to the radio. She must have received some bad news.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It seems Class B is putting on a lot of pressure in some combat zones. As a result, the number of eliminations from our allied classes is rapidly increasing. It appears there&apos;s a fierce battle going on in F11.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wanted to leave things to them to some extent, but it seemed it would be better if I made a move.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Only in the event that Class A is wiped out first, come and see me after three o&apos;clock if you can make contact.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Understood. What will you do now, Ayanokouji-kun?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Adjustments.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Leaving Shiraishi with Yamamura, I started to slowly make my way to F11.</p>",
