Each class tried its best to avoid combat and focused solely on securing supplies.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They held one another in check and watched, scurrying about various places to gather supplies.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The only spectacular development, to repeat myself, was the surprise attack by Class B and the few-minute shootout on the second day that we initiated to secure supplies.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, moment by moment, the off-limits areas were steadily increasing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For now, it was only the outer perimeter, two squares deep. In other words, each class simply had to move away from the coast and shift slightly inward; avoiding large-scale combat would&apos;ve been easy at that point.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But from the third day onward, that would almost certainly not be the case. The representatives of the Class C and Class D alliance, who set up a base in K13, began a discussion, joined by several students from both classes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Where&apos;ve you been all morning? I even went to your tent to get ya, y&apos;know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;My bad, I had some business to take care of.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I offered a light apology with my right hand, Hashimoto stared at it quizzically.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ain&apos;t it kinda dirty?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s nothing serious, don&apos;t worry about it. More importantly, let me hear what you were discussing.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hm? Oh, right&#x2014;Kanzaki, please continue.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I was just saying that we&apos;ve reached a difficult phase. We&apos;ve used most of our handheld provisions and it wouldn&apos;t be surprising if they were depleted by noon. Also, Sumida and Minamikata have seemed somewhat unwell since this morning. They themselves say they are still fine, but I don&apos;t believe they will last until the exam is over.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I received Kanzaki&apos;s report on the Class D students.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If one is the VIP, it would be a bit of a hassle, but if they&apos;re guards, having them retire now may be an option. In any case, I want you to tell them not to overdo it. The damage will only be greater if they lie to themselves and force it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Ah, yes. Saying that will likely put them both at ease. Moriyama, my apologies, but would you mind relaying Ayanokouji&apos;s words to them?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Nodding as if to say, &quot;Leave it to me,&quot; Moriyama headed off at a run toward the tents that were being taken down.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But man, we&apos;re obviously runnin&apos; low on supplies. We got nothin&apos; but a bunch of starving folks over here, too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Pressing his stomach lightly, Hashimoto muttered wearily.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. And it&apos;s already the third day of the exam; there must be a limit to how much longer we can continue collecting from a distance. Which means... a battle over supplies is finally about to begin. Let me hear your thoughts.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When Kanzaki asked me about our plan for the day, I nodded silently.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There are broadly two methods for determining our plan. One is to envision the objective you wish to achieve and map out a path to it. The other is to gauge the enemy&apos;s aim and thwart their intentions.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I spread out the map and began to explain in a way that was easy for Hashimoto and Kanzaki to understand.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;On the first day, Class B&#x2014;or rather, Ryuuen&#x2014;launched a surprise attack on Class C. What do you suppose the reason was?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s there to suppose? He figured he could deal a huge blow to the enemy by catching them off guard. It&apos;s the story of him taking a risk and successfully pulling it off, ain&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If the lottery results had been different and Class A was next to us, would he have attacked in the same way?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kanzaki crossed his arms, thought for a moment, then nodded.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Wouldn&apos;t Class A have been the ideal enemy, instead? If you think about it that way, attacking becomes the obvious choice.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;My thinking is different. I believe that if Ryuuen couldn&apos;t launch a surprise attack on Class C, he wouldn&apos;t have initiated a fight using his trump card tactic from the very beginning. Why did it have to be the lower-ranked Class C? Because in order to win, he considers my existence to be one of the most troublesome obstacles.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;To Ryuuen, you&apos;re his arch-rival now. That makes you the best opponent to take down with a sneak attack.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t say I don&apos;t get what you&apos;re saying, but even so, I can&apos;t accept the conclusion that he wouldn&apos;t have attacked Class A. Even if they weren&apos;t ideal, he should&apos;ve had no problem attacking.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If they could knock the top-ranked Class A to last place, Class B would be able to pull itself much closer to that position. What Kanzaki wanted to say was simple.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There&apos;s a troublesome presence in Class A from the start. Needless to say, it&apos;s Koenji. At the beginning, it was impossible to judge whether he intended to participate in this special exam or not. In fact, you felt he was an element of uncertainty too, didn&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Yeah, that&apos;s true.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even if he didn&apos;t intend to participate, Koenji was still with Class A for a short time after the start. Launching a surprise attack there would create the unnecessary risk of waking a sleeping lion.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see... So if Koenji took issue with the surprise attack and cooperated with his class and by some chance launched a counterattack, the situation would instantly become impossible to read, is that it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ichinose must have reported on that point as well. Kanzaki muttered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In fact, the Class B students who came into contact with Koenji were eliminated, after all... I see.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He was a person with enough potential to make one think he could change the course of the battle all by himself, a fact no one would deny.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In any case, after much consideration, Ryuuen executed a surprise attack and gained a huge advantage over Class C. But now, compared to Class A, he&apos;s lost fourteen guards and can no longer use his core tactic of disabling the overall GPS. Now that the number of out-of-bounds areas is increasing, the value of this tactic is growing with each passing moment.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If the opponent&apos;s GPS stops working when you start fighting, even for just thirty minutes, you won&apos;t know where they&apos;re coming from. It wouldn&apos;t be strange to be completely immobilized.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He himself demonstrated, through the surprise attack he launched, that a successful ambush could inflict enormous damage, even if only for a short time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So what&apos;s your take on it? Does Ryuuen plan to attack, or defend? Let me hear what you think.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He&apos;ll wait until the last possible moment without launching a hasty attack. He&apos;s waiting for the time when the out-of-bounds areas expand, making it impossible to escape far away and forcing the four classes to gather whether they like it or not.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was the closest thing to the optimal solution. The problem was whether Ryuuen could choose that answer. If he impatiently went after Class A or the allied classes, Class B might be eliminated surprisingly quickly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then should we attack instead?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, avoiding engagement is best for now. We&apos;ll stick to a defensive strategy, just like on the first and second days.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if we did nothing, the exam&apos;s end time was fixed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A development in which we would all randomly fire at each other within the shrinking area was sure to come.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And that, in fact, was the very development we were hoping for.</p>",
