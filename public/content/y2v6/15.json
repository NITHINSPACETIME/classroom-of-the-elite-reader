Or rather, nice to see you. I’m Syougo Kinugasa. This postscript is a serious one. I’m sure there’s something that you’ve all noticed by now, right? After five years, a continuation of the </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Classroom of the Elite </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">TV anime is in production to be broadcast. Although that news is so brief that it’s almost disappointing to see it put into words, a lot of hard work and toil has gone into everything leading up to this announcement. I even almost stopped writing once or twice!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">I was overwhelmed with anxieties, like “It might not be possible for more of the anime to be made.” But the reason why I’ve been able to continue writing without too many publication delays until today was because of my many readers who have been supporting me even after the original anime finished airing in 2017. Without this long and significant achievement of mine, the continuation of the anime would have never come to fruition. As&#160;an author, I couldn’t be happier and more grateful for the decision to create more of the anime. So, all of you: thank you, thank you, thank you! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Also, please allow me to state one thing very strongly: I, more than anyone else, have been eagerly awaiting a continuation of the </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Classroom</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> anime for a long, long time.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">About two years ago, talk about whether it would be turned into an anime again, and whether it even </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">could</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> be&#160;turned into an anime again, started to come up. There was a brief moment in time where I was filled with excitement, like I could feel this exclamation point swelling in my chest…but it ended up taking quite a long time because of the effects of the worldwide pandemic.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Anyway, I’m overjoyed that we were able to finally make this announcement. And please know that we aren’t going to rest on our laurels, not one bit. Everyone is going to do their best to make sure that the story connects with the original. Anyway, there’s still more to say, but that’s all on that for this postscript.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It’s been a long, long time coming, but I’m really looking forward to seeing Ayanokouji and the others grow up once again. I wonder if they’ll continue the anime all the way to the end of the story? Maybe? Maybe?!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Well, anywho… HECK YEAAAAHHH!!! HOORAYYYYYY!!!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Thank you, everyone! Thank you all for your continued support!!!</span></p>\r\n",
