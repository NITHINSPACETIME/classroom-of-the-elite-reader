IT’S ME</span><span style=\" font-size: 0.80em;\">, </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Kinugasa. Your buddy!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">You been doing good? Yeah, come to think of it, it’s been about four months since last time, huh? Sorry to get down to business right away, but I’ve got something important to tell you all, so I’d really appreciate it if you’d stick around and listen.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">…Yes. There is something I need to apologize to you about. It’s regarding the character “Ishigami Kyou” (</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">石上京</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">) from Class 1-A, who has appeared several times now throughout the 2</span><span style=\" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;\">nd</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> Year arc of the story. The correct way of writing his surname is “Ishigami” (</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">石上</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">), not “Ishigami” (</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">石神</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">). The latter is incorrect. I sincerely apologize for the delay in reporting this. As for the exact cause of this issue… It’s probably just because I was exhausted! Can’t do nothin’ ’bout that!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Everyone makes mistakes, so I ask that you please find it in your hearts to forgive me.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">And after reading that, all the readers out there laughed gently and forgave me, so this story has come to a close.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Thank you, and I sincerely hope that you continue to enjoy whatever comes your way from Ishigami-kun and from Kinugasa-kun.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Anyway, this volume covered the school trip, but I hope that it didn’t come off feeling like, “Wait, isn’t this, like, the same thing as the winter break story from Volume 7.5?” rather than a full entry into the story, as the eighth volume of this arc. That being said, this might have seemed like just a vacation story, but it may also play an important part in the future of the narrative. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Next, we’re finally nearing the end of the second semester with Volume 9, which will focus on the end of December. After that, I plan to continue on with another winter holiday story. I think I might’ve said a long, long time ago that the 2</span><span style=\" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;\">nd</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> Year arc would be shorter than the 1</span><span style=\" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;\">st</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> Year, but it actually might end up being about the same or even a little bit longer. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Everyone makes mistakes, so I ask that you please find it in your hearts to forgive me.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Also, please let me talk a little about the anime adaptation. What did you think of the second season, which made its debut in summer? I sincerely hope that as many people as possible are enjoying the animation now that it’s returned after five years. As for me personally, I’m already looking forward to season three, and that’s encouraging me to continue working hard on my writing yet again.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">There isn’t much time left in the year, but I sincerely hope that you’ll all keep supporting the series. This might be coming to you a bit early, but I hope I see you all again in good health in my postscript next year.</span></p>\r\n",
