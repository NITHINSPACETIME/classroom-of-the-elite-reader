I&apos;ve been hearing some flashy rumors lately about a stupid senpai who voluntarily transferred to Class C amidst its fall. What&apos;s the deal?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He eagerly asked the question, but his eyes weren&apos;t smiling.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He didn&apos;t seem very interested in the topic itself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, who knows what the intention is?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I deliberately responded as if it were someone else&apos;s business, Housen smiled a bit and came even closer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hah, well, I guess it doesn&apos;t matter.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Clearly, that wasn&#x2019;t the reason why he was here, and Housen continued speaking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s just that my skills have been getting dull lately, and it&apos;s bothering me. I&apos;m looking for someone to be my punching bag. Got any ideas?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He swung his large arm around, saying something suggestive.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but I&apos;m not interested in fighting.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s the deal, you&apos;re no fun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for, you should ask Ryuuen.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I thought I&#x2019;d provided some excellent information, but Housen gave an exaggerated sigh and expressed his dissatisfaction.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That guy is a chicken who won&apos;t fight one-on-one.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then you should fight multiple people at once. It&apos;d be exciting.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Once, maybe, but it&apos;s too much trouble when it&apos;s hectic all the time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If Housen went after Ryuuen, he&apos;d likely win on the spot. However, at any point in time, Ryuuen would retaliate using whatever underhanded method necessary. Housen seemed to have predicted as much.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">During the deserted island exam, they&#x2019;d directly clashed. However, since then, there hadn&apos;t been any incidents that required school intervention.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No one would willingly go after Ryuuen at this school, except perhaps the uninformed first-year students. In a sense, he&#x2019;d established an effective defense mechanism.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;By the way, does it look like you can move up to Class C?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since it was pointless to keep talking about such menacing topics, I casually asked about the second years&apos; situation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Housen and the other second-year students had spent the year without any class changes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, all classes, including Class D, were still in a good position to win.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Who knows? As long as I get money, that&apos;s all I care about. I&apos;ve thrown that responsibility to Nanase.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nanase? I didn&apos;t think you were the type to delegate tasks to others. Though, that&apos;s a good decision. Nanase seems more capable of being a solid leader than you, Housen.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You said it. So, you wanted to fight me after all, huh? Then&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Housen tried to steer the conversation back to violence.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As I faced the aggressive Housen, a slightly tense Chabashira-sensei appeared. At the sight of the teacher, Housen quietly clicked his tongue and walked away as if he&#x2019;d been interrupted.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;See you later, Paisen. I&apos;ll have fun with some interesting first years for a while, and after that, you&#x2019;ll be my sparring partner.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not interested.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I figured I&apos;d at least reply, so I did so in a voice too low to be heard.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The moment I finished replying to the departing Housen from over my shoulder, Chabashira-sensei pulled my arm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Come with me for a moment.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without allowing any room for objection, Chabashira-sensei led me to a corner.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;I wanted to talk to you. As your homeroom teacher&#x2026; no, as your former homeroom teacher, I thought it might be inappropriate to carelessly make contact, but I couldn&apos;t help wanting to check something.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Chabashira-sensei expressed her pent-up feelings.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her expression lacked vigor, and she must&apos;ve been in deep thought this week.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So you&apos;ve been following me from the dormitory.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;You noticed?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, it was quite obvious.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her tailing skills were on par with Morishita&apos;s, and to put it nicely, they weren&apos;t good.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There was no guarantee I&apos;d be leaving the dorm. How early were you waiting for me, exactly?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was still quite chilly in the mornings, despite it getting warmer by the day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was cold enough to catch a cold, but she didn&apos;t seem to mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That doesn&apos;t matter. What I want to hear about is the class transfer&#x2026; the transfer matter. What were you thinking when you decided to transfer without telling anyone&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The transfer matter, huh? Honestly, I&apos;ve been asked the same question so many times this week that I&apos;ve grown tired of it, regardless of gender or year.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, it was the first time a teacher like Chabashira-sensei had confronted me. From a teacher&apos;s perspective, it would be impossible to react to every single student&apos;s actions and transfers.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Explain what&apos;s going on.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s difficult to explain when you ask like that. There shouldn&apos;t be any problem with a student exercising their rightful option to transfer classes.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had no obligation to explain the circumstances.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Chabashira-sensei, fully aware of this, wouldn&apos;t back down at such words.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Isn&apos;t there something inconvenient&#x2026; something that forced you to transfer?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And what would that be?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When questioned back, Chabashira-sensei choked on her words, unable to articulate them clearly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I forgot to mention earlier, but the issue I mentioned about dealing with Hoshinomiya-sensei has been resolved, so you can rest assured. I don&apos;t think she will cause any more trouble for the teachers or the school.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&#x2026;!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She almost blurted something out impulsively, showing her true feelings.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though, perhaps she couldn&apos;t hold back after all. She grabbed my shoulders and started opening her mouth.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is it really because of me? Because I was troubled with Chie&apos;s problem&#x2026; Did you sacrifice yourself to solve it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I thought you might think that way, Chabashira-sensei. But don&apos;t worry. I had intended to transfer classes even before Hoshinomiya-sensei&apos;s issue came up.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She looked into my eyes, trying to ascertain whether it was the truth.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, she couldn&apos;t dispel the concern that I was covering things up with a lie.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Still, she should&apos;ve understood that I had no hesitation and not a trace of regret.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It doesn&apos;t seem like you&apos;re simply being considerate&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. I had narrowed it down to either Class C or Class D early on. It wasn&apos;t because I had complaints about the teacher or the class.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s the reason then? Why do something so meaningless&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Whether it&apos;s meaningless or not depends on how you see things. You know I&apos;m not obsessed with graduating from Class A, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This transfer is entirely for my own sake. I judged that it&apos;d be difficult to accomplish what I need to do in this school while remaining in your class. However, I will not disclose what that task is here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With this much said, she could understand that the transfer was intentional.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, I wouldn&apos;t provide excessive details.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Chabashira-sensei might unexpectedly share this conversation with Horikita and others.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&#x2019;s about time for me to head to the gym, so I&apos;ll be excusing myself.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As a teacher, she probably couldn&apos;t probe any further.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She nodded quietly, trying hard to control her expression.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Understood. I see&#x2026; sorry for taking your time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I left Chabashira-sensei standing there and headed to the gym on the second floor.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"4bdf3471-acf9-55ee-808c-b3037205dfa4\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-4bdf3471-acf9-55ee-808c-b3037205dfa4\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-4bdf3471-acf9-55ee-808c-b3037205dfa4\">[1]: </a>For those who don&apos;t remember, &quot;paisen&quot; is Housen&apos;s informal way of saying the honorific, &quot;senpai.&quot;</p></li></ol>",
