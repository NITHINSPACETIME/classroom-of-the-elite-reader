So, we&apos;re all good with leaving this special exam up to Ayanokouji, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He asked everyone, assuming their consent rather than seeking permission.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No one said yes or no, and the classroom momentarily fell silent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, soon after, Shimazaki glared at Hashimoto without holding back his dissatisfaction.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And why&apos;s that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why? I could ask you the same. This special exam is a good opportunity for a transfer like Ayanokouji to show his abilities. If we don&apos;t leave it to him now, then when? It makes you wonder why we recruited him in the first place.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even though I&#xa0;wasn&apos;t welcomed, Hashimoto argued fiercely, thinking it was obvious.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And what if we lose?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Lose? Don&apos;t be stupid, there&apos;s no way we&apos;ll lose. Right, Ayanokouji?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto looked at me with an expression full of expectation and pressure.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t guarantee our victory or defeat, but if you entrust me with it, I intend to give it my all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I took a complete turn from my confident speech after the opening ceremony, deliberately playing it safe with my words, which led me to receive my classmates&apos; cold glares in return.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hearing that the outcome was uncertain, naturally, they couldn&apos;t believe it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ha&#x2026; that&apos;s what he says, Hashimoto.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At such times, Sakayanagi probably would&apos;ve already declared, &apos;We will win.&apos;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The difference in our answers might&apos;ve confused and disappointed some of them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Come on, be more decisive. It makes the rest of us worried. I&apos;m starting to worry myself&#xa0;too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Scratching his head, Hashimoto sighed and looked away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So, Shimazaki, what do you plan to do if we don&apos;t plan on leaving it to Ayanokouji?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nothing special. We&apos;ll just fight like normal and win like normal.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Normal? Then who will come up with the strategy?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We can discuss it as a class. Of course, I don&apos;t oppose Ayanokouji joining in.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So you mean we don&apos;t need a leader?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s not what I&apos;m saying. Of course we need a leader. Someone has to steer the class when there&apos;s a dispute. But I just can&apos;t feel like entrusting him with this special exam. I&apos;ll be clear, from what I&apos;ve heard, this exam is one we should naturally win. We&apos;ve been leading in written exam scores for two years, and our opponent has always been the lowest-scoring class, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto grunted slightly, but he soon countered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If it were a simple written exam, yes, but this is a special exam. Can we really win by charging in without thinking?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not saying that we won&apos;t be thinking. I&apos;m saying we should discuss it as a class if necessary.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The more people there are, the easier it is for information to leak.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There won&apos;t be any idiots who&apos;ll leak it. I don&apos;t know about you, though.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How nice of you to say.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Watching the argument between Hashimoto and Shimazaki, Sanada stood up to mediate.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;May I ask Ayanokouji-kun a question?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Looking at this special exam, I think the key point lies in who gets the penalty points. If we leave it to you, you&apos;ll be able to predict who the opponent will send out for the small-group battles and who we should select to avoid being targeted&#x2026; is it okay to assume that? If you can tell us that much, then I might consider entrusting this to you, Ayanokouji-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Providing help to Hashimoto&apos;s case, Sanada followed up with a suggestion that could make those who were skeptical yield to letting me take the lead.&#xa0;Sanada looked at Shimazaki calmly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;I see. So it&apos;s not about judging Ayanokouji based on the outcome, but measuring his abilities through the process.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. I also feel like we have a high chance of winning this special exam. However, if there&apos;s anything that could turn the tables, it&#x2019;ll be the distribution of penalty points in the small-group battles. Discussing it as a group doesn&apos;t guarantee the best solution. Entrusting it solely to Ayanokouji-kun has its risks, but as Hashimoto-kun said, there will come a time when we must entrust him with something. Maybe this exam is a good opportunity to make a quick and conclusive decision.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a compromise that incorporated both Hashimoto&#x2019;s and Shimazaki&#x2019;s opinions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Indeed&#x2026; not a bad idea. Ayanokouji, we can leave it to you, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you entrust it to me, I&apos;ll do my best.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was all I said, but Shimazaki immediately raised his voice.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Alright! Then, since winning is a given, we&apos;ll focus on whether your guesses match up, okay?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Okay, okay. Let&apos;s go with that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto, having secured the plans, nodded in satisfaction and clapped his hands together, making a loud sound.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He must&apos;ve thought that anything was possible as long as I was just given the chance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s settled then. We&apos;ll handle the details from here. Just sit back and relax.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;ll see about that. For now, I guess I&apos;ll just have to rack my brains over whom to assign these to.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In case the discussion dragged on, potentially resulting in them unexpectedly retracting their plans, Hashimoto urged everyone to disperse.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So, Ayanokouji, make sure you have plenty of time after this.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Looks like I won&apos;t be able to go home right after school ends.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hashimoto Masayoshi seems quite bothered about his exclusion in the transfer talks.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He definitely looked quite determined not to let discussions proceed without him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is it really okay to let someone who might betray us in on our strategy?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Morishita whispered her doubts from right behind me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Your trust in Hashimoto is pretty thin, huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It couldn&apos;t possibly be thick, can it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since our seats were one behind the other, it was convenient for having these small types of chats. Sensing Hashimoto approaching, Morishita cut the conversation short.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let&apos;s go, Ayanokouji. What about you, Morishita?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I might as well keep you company for the time being. I&apos;m interested in seeing your skills.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Whether it&apos;s the dorm, karaoke, or behind the school building, I&apos;ll join you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Choosing a location for strategizing usually meant picking a place away from prying eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, I deliberately suggested holding the meeting at a caf&#xe9; as per usual.</p>",
