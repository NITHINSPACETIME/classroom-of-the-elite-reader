However, with a faculty meeting in session, I changed my direction and headed toward the chairman&apos;s office to submit my notice. The chairman did seem a bit surprised, but perhaps that man had already informed him&#x2014;he decided against asking any further questions. Afterward, the various arrangements swiftly proceeded; which included the verification of the twenty million points and their source.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having heard about this right before the homeroom period started, I was sure that it&apos;d take some time for Mashima-sensei to understand that this was in fact real.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With a hint of bewilderment still remaining on his face, Mashima-sensei, the homeroom teacher, cleared his throat and looked at me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For what it&apos;s worth, I think I should introduce myself here. What do you think?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, it wasn&apos;t my first time at this school.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From the time I&apos;d spent in this school up until now, even though we might have been in different classes, I remembered everyone&apos;s names and faces.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And all the Class C students were aware of me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, I still had to go through the formalities.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The opening ceremony just ended, but I, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, have transferred to this class using twenty million Private Points. I can&apos;t replace Sakayanagi, who voluntarily withdrew, but if there&apos;s still a will to fight among everyone here, I&apos;m confident that I can help overcome the class&apos;s greatly deteriorated situation.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I kept it brief, but I firmly conveyed what was necessary.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Reflecting on my past failure during my self-introduction as a first-year student, I chose my words carefully.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I think it was a passing mark, but I wonder if my intentions were properly conveyed to the students here.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As everyone silently watched, one student broke the silence and clapped.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Glad to have ya, Ayanokouji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was the biggest investor in my transfer to Class C&#x2014;Hashimoto Masayoshi.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Starting from there, a few others began to clap sporadically.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, I could see that not everybody was welcoming.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The looks directed at me weren&apos;t all warm.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Rather, the majority of their gazes were cold, and many of them weren&apos;t truly welcoming.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, I didn&apos;t expect everyone to accept me from the beginning.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Rather, it would speak poorly of the class&apos;s quality if that were the case..</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It would be like them introducing themselves as a feeble gathering of a class&#x2014;one that, upon losing Sakayanagi, had now lost all of its ability to judge situations, leaving everything to a helper<sup id=\"fnref-1-b702813e-7648-5d2c-9e4b-04e4dafc1c0f\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-b702813e-7648-5d2c-9e4b-04e4dafc1c0f\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup>&#xa0;that shouldn&apos;t be so easily trusted.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They had to be cautious, skeptical, and willing to seek results rapidly and aggressively.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But Mashima-sensei, unaware that the students were thinking of the situation to such an extent, picked up on the awkward atmosphere and resumed homeroom.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well then, as for Ayanokouji&apos;s seat&#x2026; Let&#x2019;s see here&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Still unable to fully hide the hint of bewilderment on his face, Mashima-sensei looked around the classroom.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Currently, there were thirty-six students in the class, excluding me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In terms of the seating arrangement alone, securing enough space for four seats wouldn&apos;t be a problem.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It might be ideal to assign my seat to one of the four less populated rows, but&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Perhaps this timing could be used to change around the seating arrangement?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Before Mashima-sensei could decide, a female student sitting by the window in the very back raised her hand swiftly enough for it to make a noise.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For now, I believe the seat in front of me would be suitable.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Either surprised by the statement or by the student who made it, Mashima-sensei showed unmistakable confusion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In front of Morishita&apos;s&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yes, it was the eccentric Morishita Ai who spoke.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. I will explain the reasons. First, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka is like a transfer student, meaning he is new to the class and unfamiliar with it. Placing him in the center of the class right away would make him shrink back like a loner. And giving him the most coveted spot at the back by the window, my position, would be too much of a privilege. Moreover, since he&apos;s an unexpected foreign element from an opposing class, who was an enemy until recently, proper surveillance is necessary. Considering all these factors, I think it&apos;s best for him to sit in front of me. If anyone has objections, please speak up now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">None of the students objected to Morishita&apos;s proposal, which was biased and something she decided entirely on her own.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Well, wherever my seat ends up, it probably won&apos;t be a big issue.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As the homeroom teacher, if the students agreed on a location without objections, Mashima-sensei probably wouldn&apos;t outright reject it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was only one issue remaining&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>What&apos;s left is whether the student sitting in front of Morishita would accept this proposal&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If Sugio is fine with it&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As Mashima-sensei tried to get confirmation with Sugio Hiroshi, who was currently sitting there&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course, it&apos;s fine.&#xa0;Change it right away&#x2014; No, rather, I&apos;d be happy if you could please change it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He eagerly accepted the chance to move his seat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Rather, he had an expression that made it seem like he was more than happy that he could move.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Alright. Then, let&apos;s have Sugio move over to the back of the empty row.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sugio responded eagerly, quickly gathered his belongings, and stood up from his seat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having received the consent of the student who needed to be moved first,&#xa0;Mashima-sensei immediately brought in a new chair and desk.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then, Ayanokouji, please take your seat. We&apos;ll proceed with homeroom.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Understood.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I took my spot in front of Morishita like she&#x2019;d proposed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As soon as I sat down, Morishita called out to me from behind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;ll be a pleasure going forward, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes, likewise.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although Class C as a whole was still somewhat unsettled, it was considerably quieter compared to the Horikita class that I was familiar with. Even though they were told in advance about the transfer, many students must not have thought that it would actually happen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As expected, the students&apos; fundamental qualities here appeared to be generally quite high.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a relief to have an environment that was easy to navigate at this point, as it reduced the amount of trouble involved.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With the OAA, I already had a grasp on all of the students&apos; faces, names,&#xa0;and basic abilities.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, like myself, there were often aspects to each student&apos;s abilities that weren&apos;t visible through school evaluations alone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Discovering these in my new school life going forward would be one of my top priorities.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With only one more year of school life, there was no time for leisure.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having said that, saying something like, &apos;There&apos;s no time, open up to me right away,&apos; wasn&apos;t something you could just go and approach people with.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A middle ground, a balance, was required.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What are you thinking about, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Behind me, I could hear Morishita whispering.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;About what&apos;s to come.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Wondering if you can make a hundred friends?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t know why she suddenly asked that question in a rhythmic tone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Indeed, getting to know classmates involved making friends to some extent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not about that&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since, in essence, it was off the mark, I denied it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re not thinking about wanting to eat <em>onigiri </em>with a hundred people?<sup id=\"fnref-2-fe542ea8-b1d0-5a94-8452-45a22a68af60\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-2-fe542ea8-b1d0-5a94-8452-45a22a68af60\" data-ref=\"2\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[2]</a></sup>&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not thinking about that&#x2026; or rather, I don&apos;t understand what you mean by &apos;<em>onigiri</em>&#xa0;with a hundred people.&apos;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>And why&apos;s she continuing with her rhythmic tone?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Please turn this way.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Following her instruction, I turned around, and I was met with Morishita&apos;s cold stare.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji Kiyotaka is surprisingly stupid, huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s quite the thing to say.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I thought her unrealistic idea of making a hundred friends and eating <em>onigiri </em>together was more absurd.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You don&apos;t even know this joke&#x2014;no, it&apos;s not even a joke&#x2014;it&apos;s a classic reference. Are you sane?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nobody can probably understand that joke.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As I responded, she took a deep, deep sigh.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Rather than calling you stupid, it might be more accurate to say you&apos;re ignorant, or maybe you&apos;re out of touch with the world.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She seemed to be getting disappointed all on her own, but I had no idea why.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Can you make a hundred friends?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Do you want to eat onigiri with a hundred people?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I tried to think about it calmly for a moment, but I still couldn&apos;t understand the meaning.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Enough. Make sure to face forward and listen earnestly to what the homeroom teacher says.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>It was you, Morishita, who turned me around, though&#x2026;</em></p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"b702813e-7648-5d2c-9e4b-04e4dafc1c0f\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-b702813e-7648-5d2c-9e4b-04e4dafc1c0f\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-b702813e-7648-5d2c-9e4b-04e4dafc1c0f\">[1]: </a>The kanji used for &quot;helper&quot; here, &#x52a9;&#x3063;&#x4eba;, can also be translated to a &quot;foreign player,&quot; which is an outsider that&apos;s hired to strengthen a team.</p></li><li data-id=\"fe542ea8-b1d0-5a94-8452-45a22a68af60\" data-ref=\"2\" class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-2-fe542ea8-b1d0-5a94-8452-45a22a68af60\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-2-fe542ea8-b1d0-5a94-8452-45a22a68af60\">[2]: </a>Morishita&apos;s lines about a hundred friends and eating <em>onigiri</em>&#xa0;are references to the song &quot;&#x4e00;&#x5e74;&#x751f;&#x306b;&#x306a;&#x3063;&#x305f;&#x3089;&quot; (lit. &quot;When I Become a First Year&quot;).</p></li></ol>",
