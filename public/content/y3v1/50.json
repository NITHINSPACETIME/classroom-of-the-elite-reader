Every two months, the top-ranked participant would graduate from the show and secure new work.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Conversely, the lowest-ranked would drop out and be replaced by a new candidate.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed to be a long-running show, having passed its third anniversary.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had only started watching it a few months ago.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To see the idol in the making who had joined the show.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Their numbers were pinned on their chests in order of age.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My favorite idol was wearing the number nine.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&quot;Let&apos;s get right to it and announce the first topic! Ta-da! The steaming hot oden reaction battle!&quot;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A crudely written flip chart was turned over.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Last time, when she first appeared on an online show, she was barely known. However, she had managed to secure sixth place in the popularity vote, which was a promising start.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her conversational skills were admittedly not great, but her earnestness and dedication to every challenge had captured some fans&apos; hearts.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I watched the screen intently, waiting for her turn.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She nervously watched the previous idols&apos; reactions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is it okay if I talk a little?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I started muttering to myself and continued.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, that&apos;s right. He transferred.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was also a monologue. Knowing it wouldn&apos;t reach her, I spoke to the girl through the screen. A considerable amount of time had passed since we last met.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But her feelings on the other side of the screen hadn&apos;t changed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I remembered last week&apos;s topic.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&apos;Please confess who your first love was.&apos;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She confessed her true feelings with a shy expression.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was about someone she met in her first year of high school, and whom she still had a crush on.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From the outside, it could&apos;ve seemed like a painful event, a past she wouldn&apos;t want to remember.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yet, instead of being gloomy, that girl had started walking forward.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I, who should&apos;ve been leading and holding her hand, was left behind before I knew it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She was helping me. From afar, she waved and smiled at me, telling me to walk.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then I had to walk.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As a friend worthy of her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Still, her impulsive remarks were risky and made everyone around her panic.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As an idol, admitting to having a crush was still immature.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But that was okay.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Because she was still an idol in training.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And a crush is still safe, right?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe you should&apos;ve shown this side of yourself to Ayanokouji-kun sooner...?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her striving figure.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her bright smile.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Knowing this, could it have changed Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s feelings about his class?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;No.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Probably not.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s heart, her presence must&apos;ve vanished.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If it were to sprout again, it would be after zero turned into one.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Not the zero from Advanced Nurturing High School, when you couldn&apos;t do anything.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But the idol who was fighting hard on the other side of this screen, transformed into one.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wish she could say this back then&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&apos;Thanks to that time, I&apos;ve become stronger. I&apos;m not interested in you anymore, though.&apos;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, even Ayanokouji-kun would be taken aback.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No&#x2026; she wouldn&apos;t say something like that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She would definitely show her sincere gratitude.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Not as a two-faced idol, but as a clumsy idol who only fought honestly and directly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Keep going&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I cheered her on through the screen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Now, I can only see her through the screen. She can&apos;t hear my voice.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>My voice won&apos;t reach her.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>But I won&apos;t stop.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Keep going&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Over and over.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&apos;d keep cheering.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ll also work hard for one more year&#x2026; so you won&apos;t laugh at me when we finally meet on the outside, okay?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had long been overtaken by her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">So, no matter what, I must not stop.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had to chase after her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Now wasn&apos;t the time to be discouraged by Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s actions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Let&apos;s work hard together.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>And in one year, I&apos;ll definitely go to meet you&#x2014;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Keep going, Airi.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I called her name and smiled at her through the screen.</p>",
