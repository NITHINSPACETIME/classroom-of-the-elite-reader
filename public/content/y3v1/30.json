I don&apos;t make ladies wait.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;From the way you talk, it sounds like you&apos;ve been waiting for a while.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No way. I&#x2019;ve been waiting since 9:30.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>That&apos;s obviously early. Had he been waiting for an hour?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>He&apos;s significantly passionate about the person he&apos;s interested in, but it&apos;s doubtful whether waiting an hour early would actually increase his favorability. It would be strange if he went out of his way to point this out, and he might even give the impression that he&apos;s too intense.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This initial impression&#x2014;previously, I probably wouldn&apos;t have been able to interpret this situation as smoothly as I just had.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Through my association with Karuizawa, I came to understand this line of thinking better.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, when it came to love, there was no absolute correct answer, and the difficult part was that you had to see through the person you were interested in and approach them in a suitable manner.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do you like Shiraishi?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I thought he did, and Shiraishi, the person he appeared affectionate to, felt the same way too, so there didn&apos;t seem to be any mistakes about it, but I wanted to confirm just in case.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What!? I-It&apos;s not like I like her or anything! What are you talking about all of a sudden!?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I see. So he does </em><strong><em>like </em></strong><em>her</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The opposite of &apos;not liking&apos; is &apos;liking,&apos; and the opposite of &apos;liking&apos; is &apos;not liking.&apos; In love, things that wouldn&apos;t normally make sense can happen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This was one of the clear-cut examples typically shown.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&#x2019;m just checking.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Wait, do you&#x2026; do you like Shiraishi? Did you break up with Karuizawa and transfer classes just for this, huh? Is that it!?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although he said he didn&#x2019;t like her, he clearly wasn&apos;t calm; rather, he was openly hostile, though he seemed completely unaware of it. His interpretation of my question was wildly presumptuous.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Unfortunately, I don&apos;t have those types of feelings for her.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You don&apos;t have to lie, man. It doesn&apos;t matter to me. Hey, maybe I could even help you get along with Shiraishi if you want me to?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He forced himself to stay calm, but of course, he didn&apos;t feel at ease at all.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He kept digging his own grave, but there was no point in continuing this topic.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ll pass. Instead, I want you to tell me about the class. There are things I want to know.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Acting tough, huh? Well, fine, you just transferred here, and you need to know about the class. I&apos;ll make a special effort to teach you, so ask... or rather, just ask Hashimoto. He thinks highly of you, and he&apos;ll even tell you more information than what&apos;s needed.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There are things I can&apos;t ask Hashimoto about.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Like how the class evaluates Hashimoto and how they feel about him. That kind of thing.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even Hashimoto, who had a generally strong grasp of the class, would struggle to analyze this matter objectively and give accurate reports on it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Our evaluation of Hashimoto, huh? Well, it&#x2019;s definitely more negative than positive, that&apos;s for sure. I think he&apos;s managing things quite skillfully, though.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As he voiced his own thoughts, Yoshida shifted his gaze to the lobby.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At the same time, a bright and cheerful voice could be heard.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Good morning, Yoshi, Ayanokouji-kun!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The person who appeared at the meeting location wasn&apos;t Shiraishi, but unexpectedly, Nishikawa Ryouko. It looked like she was just casually chatting with me as a new classmate, yet she came to a stop right in front of us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Please take care of me today.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah, it&apos;s Nishikawa&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You don&apos;t have to look so unwelcoming~&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you with Shiraishi by any chance?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course. You didn&apos;t think you could have a date just with Asuka, did you, Ayanokouji-kun?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I didn&apos;t think of it as a date.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t like I didn&apos;t have any expectations in terms of deepening my friendly connections and companionships here, but it was different from the direction Nishikawa imagined.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh? Really? You came out so easily when you were invited on a day off. You must&apos;ve been expecting something good, especially you, Yoshi, definitely.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, that&apos;s not it! What are you misunderstanding?!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed that those were indeed Yoshida&apos;s intentions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Look, Yoshi. I&apos;m going to give you some important advice as a classmate.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Asuka is the one person you shouldn&apos;t be going after. Oh, and this is advice for Ayanokouji-kun too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As she approached, Nishikawa<sup id=\"fnref-1-5beaeea1-da88-5152-8cb8-72c4781c3299\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-5beaeea1-da88-5152-8cb8-72c4781c3299\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup>&#xa0;looked around and slightly lowered her voice.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Asuka&apos;s experience level isn&apos;t like that of your ordinary student, you know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Experience level? What could that mean?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Huh&#x2026;? E-Experience level?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed we had the same suspicions, but Yoshida seemed to have realized something.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You know what I mean. The&#xa0;&apos;<strong>Hundred-Man Slayer</strong>&apos;&#xa0;Asuka&#x2014;you&apos;ve heard that nickname, haven&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;That rumor&apos;s real&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course. It&apos;s not the type of story that spreads if it&apos;s a lie.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wasn&apos;t sure what exactly happened, but it was clear that Yoshida was greatly shaken.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, I couldn&apos;t understand the meaning of that nickname.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It wasn&#x2019;t a hundred friends?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh? What&apos;s this hundred friends thing?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Seems like it&apos;s completely unrelated&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&#xa0;still couldn&apos;t forget the rhythm Morishita had hummed that one time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The &apos;Hundred-Man Slayer&apos; nickname means she&apos;s been in that kind of relationship with a hundred guys. She&apos;s cute and, you know, has a sexy vibe, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&apos;That kind of relationship.&apos; It sounded vague, but it was probably talking about a close relationship.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not sure. I don&apos;t know about that part, but I understand what you&apos;re trying to say.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Apparently, my seatmate was far more of a specialist in romance than I was.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do you think Yoshi could win over Asuka?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I-I already said I&apos;m not interested!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then let&apos;s leave it at that. Take this chance to give up. Or&#x2026; well, if you kneel down, you might be able to have sweet dreams for one night.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Seriously?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hmm? Didn&apos;t you just say you weren&apos;t interested?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed that Nishikawa liked to tease people.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If I were to compare her to someone, she seemed similar to Amasawa.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Does that &apos;Hundred-Man Slayer&apos; expression change to the &apos;Two-Hundred-Man Slayer&apos; when it reaches two hundred?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I threw out the question, simply curious, and Nishikawa widened her eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji-kun, you sure make some interesting expressions despite your appearance.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is that so? I just asked what I was wondering about.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The answer is probably no.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see. It doesn&apos;t roll off the tongue, does it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not that&#x2026; It&apos;s more like a &apos;hundred&apos; is enough? The number&apos;s not really important&#x2014;it&apos;s the status&#x2014;that&apos;s what I&apos;m saying.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Status, huh? In romance, having that kind of advantage does influence things.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Haa&#x2026; All of a sudden, I&apos;m a bit tired from waiting since this morning. I&apos;ll just sit and wait.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps having used up his morning energy, Yoshida started walking toward a nearby bench with a somewhat disheartened look.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Watching Yoshida with amusement, Nishikawa then turned her gaze in my direction.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Generally, boys who hear about that fact about Asuka react in two ways. They either get shocked, depressed, and totally turned off by the hundred-men saying, or they blatantly show their ulterior motives, wanting to be the 101st. I wonder which way Yoshi will go. So far, you don&apos;t seem to fit either scenario, Ayanokouji-kun, but how do you actually feel?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve come to respect her. It&apos;s honestly amazing for someone my age to be involved with a hundred people.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh? Is that what you really think&#x2026;? It really does seem like you feel that way, huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Isn&apos;t a specialist in any field worthy of respect? Sorry to bring up my previous class, but it&apos;s like&#xa0;Sudou in basketball, Onodera in swimming, or Inogashira in sewing.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know much about sewing, but&#x2026; Ayanokouji-kun&#x2026; you even transferred to a lower class on your own free will. You&apos;re definitely different.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&#x2019;d intended to genuinely compliment Shiraishi&apos;s &apos;Hundred-Man Slayer&apos; title, but somehow it seemed to have put her off a bit. The smile that was on Nishikawa&apos;s face since she arrived turned into a slightly strained grin.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Hmm. No, wait a minute.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Nishikawa pursed her lips in a troubled manner, seemingly deep in thought.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey. If you really want to know, should I tell you something interesting, just for you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With a renewed smile and a slightly mischievous grin, Nishikawa came closer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why Asuka&apos;s called the &apos;Hundred-Man Slayer,&apos; and why she wanted to go out with you today, Ayanokouji-kun&#x2014;there&apos;s actually a big reason for that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A big reason?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was well communicated, but it was a somewhat concerning remark.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I traced my memory back to the day of the opening ceremony.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Morishita took the initiative to arrange my seat within the class. It was a coincidence that Shiraishi Asuka was next to me, but if Morishita was involved with these two, that might change the story&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Will you listen? Especially since it&apos;s a story I can&apos;t let Yoshi hear.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sure.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Due to our height difference, I slightly hunched my back so that I could hear what came out of Nishikawa&apos;s mouth.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s because Asuka thinks it&apos;d be okay to make you the 101st, Ayanokouji-kun. Of course, she isn&apos;t romantically interested in you. She&apos;s just playing around. How about it? Feeling happy?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It appeared to be some kind of secret message from Nishikawa, but I highly doubted whether it was actually genuine.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s your intention behind this?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nothing much. Just talking about becoming involved in a relationship and having fun between a man and a woman.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but if that&apos;s true, I&apos;d refuse.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;W-Why?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If I were to have that kind of relationship with Shiraishi, it&apos;s possible that you or Shiraishi herself would spread the information. If so, then it wouldn&apos;t take long for it to inevitably reach Yoshida&#x2019;s ears. It would only become a hindrance for my battles in Class C.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With that, I distanced myself from Nishikawa.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Nishikawa narrowed her eyes, seemingly a bit dissatisfied with my refusal.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I might have to reconsider my impression of you, Ayanokouji-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Up until now, it seemed like she was just teasing a newcomer, but her words clearly showed her discontent and even something akin to hostility.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Good morning.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As the appointed time approached, the person in question, Shiraishi, appeared from the lobby.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Morning, Asuka!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Immediately, her tense emotions dissipated, and Nishikawa reverted to her earlier self.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yoshida, who&#x2019;d been sulking on the bench, also quickly ran over to us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After standing next to Shiraishi, Nishikawa greeted us again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Once again, let&apos;s get along today, Ayanokouji-kun. Oh, and you too, Yoshi.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Come on, am I just an afterthought?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Seems like understanding the class&apos;s internal affairs might be more challenging than I expected.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Led by Nishikawa, we headed to karaoke at Keyaki Mall.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In a private room with an L-shaped seating arrangement, Shiraishi, Nishikawa, I, and Yoshida sat in that order from the back.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Let&apos;s start singing right away.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without even looking at the food menu, Nishikawa handed the microphone she was holding to Yoshida.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Am I supposed to be singing first? Shouldn&apos;t Ayanokouji start since he&apos;s the&#xa0;newcomer?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s what you&apos;d call a &apos;harassment of power,&apos; you know? You have to show us how it&apos;s done first, Yoshi.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But I don&apos;t really like singing that much&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Nishikawa approached the reluctant Yoshida and whispered something in his ear.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Immediately after, Yoshida gave a hard slap to both his cheeks and psyched himself up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Guess it can&apos;t help it. I&apos;ll sing!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was easy to guess what she&#x2019;d just whispered to him, but Yoshida seemed motivated anyway.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As Yoshida&apos;s chosen song began to play, Nishikawa asked me to switch places.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As instructed, I switched seats, and Shiraishi stood up and closed the distance between us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The distance was so close that our clothes almost touched.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ve been wanting to have a proper conversation with you at least once, Ayanokouji-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We sit next to each other, couldn&apos;t we have done it anytime?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s never very relaxing at school.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yoshida&apos;s singing wasn&apos;t very good, but it was heartfelt and filled the room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Nishikawa was chanting along and keeping the atmosphere lively.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s questionable whether you could call this environment relaxing either.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There should at least be a small boundary or simply some personal space between guys and girls, but it seemed Shiraishi didn&apos;t try to maintain that, rather, she continued staying close to me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Could this be one of Shiraishi&#x2019;s techniques as the &apos;Hundred-Man Slayer&apos;?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ryouko-san is my best friend.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I had a feeling you two were close. You seem to spend a lot of time with Nishikawa during breaks and lunch.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Eventually, the first song ended, and the karaoke room regained its silence.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey, you two, aren&apos;t you whispering a bit too closely over there!?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Your singing was wonderful, Yoshida-kun. I request an encore.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Eh? Really? If you say so&#x2026; But still, the distance between you two&#x2014;!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Alright, Yoshi. Shall we go for the second song?!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without allowing him any chance to refuse, Nishikawa, seated next to him, prevented Yoshida from escaping as he tried to put down the microphone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Now that we&apos;re in the same class, let&apos;s exchange contact information.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s definitely something we should do.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">We both took our phones out and gave each other our numbers so that we could make calls and send each other messages.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Feel free to contact me anytime.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From our distance and the nuances in her words, Shiraishi&apos;s familiarity, kindness, and consideration were evident.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>But are these words truly sincere?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m wondering why you&apos;re acting so kind to me? Most of the class is still keeping their distance from me and observing from afar, like Shimazaki and the others, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We sit next to each other. And the fact that we ended up alone together this morning, I believe it was fate.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s something as significant as fate&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe not for you, Ayanokouji-kun, but I genuinely interpret it that way.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As she spoke, Shiraishi touched my hand without Yoshida seeing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Your fingers are long, and your nails are beautiful. Such lovely hands.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but let go of my hand. Yoshida might see and misinterpret our relationship.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I conveyed my concerns, and Shiraishi slowly released my hand, looking a bit surprised.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You really are interesting, Ayanokouji-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It might be better to separate this matter from whatever Nishikawa was saying about Shiraishi and the opposite sex.&#xa0;At first glance, it might seem that way, but Shiraishi&apos;s eyes were not conveying such things.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&apos;<em>What an interesting experimental subject, like looking at a guinea pig in a small box.&apos;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At least, that seemed to be what her eyes were conveying to me.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"5beaeea1-da88-5152-8cb8-72c4781c3299\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-5beaeea1-da88-5152-8cb8-72c4781c3299\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-5beaeea1-da88-5152-8cb8-72c4781c3299\">[1]: </a>In the raw, &quot;Shiraishi&quot; was in place of &quot;Nishikawa&quot; here, with the literal translation meaning, &quot;As she approached, Shiraishi looked around and lowered her voice slightly,&quot; however, it&apos;s clear that she hadn&apos;t arrived yet, so we believe it may be a mistake and changed it.</p></li></ol>",
