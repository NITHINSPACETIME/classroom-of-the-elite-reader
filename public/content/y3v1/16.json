Though, it was irrelevant for those who had already decided on their path, or for a few students like me, whose paths were already set even without requiring any intervention.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If there are no particular questions, then this homeroom period is&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Mashima-sensei began to conclude the class. Since the others weren&apos;t informed about my transfer to Class 3-C until the last minute, there was a possibility that Class 3-A students, including Horikita, might swarm in.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, I wouldn&apos;t panic and run away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After all, I was bound to be confronted somewhere in the future.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Still, such a commotion here could lead to some unexpected issues.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It&apos;d be safer to change locations before that happened.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Besides, I had a meeting with a certain student afterward.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As the homeroom period was declared over, I was about to stand up. However, having pulled his chair out prematurely, it was Hashimoto who stood up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kay. So, how about we all throw a welcome party for Ayanokouji at Keyaki Mall and make it flashy?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was his proposal to his classmates.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, immediately after, the classroom was enveloped in a tense atmosphere.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&#xa0;quietly and discreetly lowered my hips, which had begun to rise, back onto the chair.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Mashima-sensei, who was about to leave the classroom, also stopped and turned back to check his students&apos; reactions.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For a few seconds, no one said anything during that silent time.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was Yoshida who broke the silence.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but I&apos;m against it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He stated his refusal flatly, with minimal emotion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;C&#x2019;mon now, why would you say that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto, who had his spirits dashed, slumped his shoulders in an overexaggerated way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Think about how Ayanokouji would feel, being left out and ignored right away by his new buddies.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Being left out&#x2014;is that going to be the case?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For now, I tried to think about how that would feel.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&#x2026;Well, at least it wouldn&apos;t feel good&#x2026; I think.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was bothersome not because I wasn&apos;t welcomed, but because the classroom atmosphere soured over a topic involving me, and it felt complicated watching as a bystander.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Since I hadn&apos;t expected a proposal for a welcome party without having built any relationships, there was nothing to do but watch after such a statement had been made.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Because of my position, I couldn&apos;t just say &apos;please do it&apos; or &apos;I refuse.&apos;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Personally, it would&apos;ve been best if things had continued as usual&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto&apos;s actions were out of consideration for me, so I couldn&apos;t blame him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not that we&apos;re rejecting Ayanokouji. It&apos;s because we&apos;re prepared to welcome him that we all contributed Private Points to support the class transfer. But you understand that it&apos;s not easy to genuinely welcome him, right? Now that we&apos;ve fallen to Class C, we can&apos;t afford to fail any special exams from now on. First, it&apos;s necessary for us to see results that prove he&apos;s a valuable ally. If that happens, we&apos;ll acknowledge Ayanokouji as a comrade and welcome him without you having to say anything, Hashimoto.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having stated the reason for refusing the welcome party, Yoshida stood up from his seat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I agree too. He hasn&apos;t done anything yet, and there&apos;s even a possibility that he&apos;s a spy, so I don&apos;t feel like putting on a forced smile and having a welcome party.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Following that, Machida also expressed his opinion, and one after another, the Class C students began to leave.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Seriously&#x2026; this is tough.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After scratching his head, Hashimoto turned towards me and made a slight gesture of apology, but I gestured back that I wasn&apos;t bothered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">One by one, the students left, and soon, only a few remained in the classroom.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although it was partly because we&#x2019;d been enemies up until now, I hadn&apos;t actively interacted with this class&apos;s students. Among those who remained were Hashimoto, Morishita, Yamamura, and Sanada&#x2014;members with whom I&#x2018;d started to form some connections through events.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Conversely, it meant that almost nobody else was left.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, you&apos;re spectacularly unpopular. It&apos;s like you&apos;re leftover merchandise.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s natural that they can&apos;t welcome me wholeheartedly.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;True, but if the transfer student had been someone like Ichinose Honami, Kushida Kikyou, or Hirata Yousuke, would the same thing have happened?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I imagined what&apos;d happen if the students she listed were the ones in my position.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even a brief thought brought a clear scene to mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even if it wouldn&apos;t be everyone, they would&apos;ve been surrounded by smiles, welcoming the newcomer.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Well&#x2026; maybe.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not &apos;maybe,&apos; it&apos;s true. Being too reserved in your assessment is a bit stingy, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She relentlessly shattered even the slightest possibility of a future where that wouldn&apos;t happen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;In other words, the fact that you are unpopular is undeniably true, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A harsh accusation. I couldn&apos;t deny it even if I wanted to.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You should start by accepting that reality.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That seems like a good idea&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Somehow, I might&apos;ve felt a bit sentimental.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As&#xa0;Morishita&apos;s remarks continued to echo in my ears, Yamamura and Sanada also left with looks of apology.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After seeing them off, Hashimoto approached and tapped me on the right shoulder.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, Ayanokouji. Our numbers might&apos;ve decreased a bit, but let&apos;s have a welcome party.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Who&apos;s attending?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For now, it&apos;s just me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was hardly &apos;a bit,&apos; but I saw no reason to refuse.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>If even one person welcomes me, I&apos;ll start by accepting their welcome.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah, right. You&apos;ll come, right, Morishita? It&apos;s boring without girls.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Trying to invite a second person, Hashimoto called out to Morishita, who was still there.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Morishita responded immediately&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, I refuse.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She declined without a moment&apos;s delay.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Come on, don&apos;t refuse. You&apos;re on our side, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Please stop. I don&apos;t want to be associated with a traitor and someone unpopular. I have plans to go on an adventure after school, so excuse me. <em>Taking off</em>.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She quickly grabbed her bag, stood up, and left the classroom at a brisk pace.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Now, only a few students, both male and female, remained in the classroom.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The girl sitting next to me had been looking our way, but she stood up when her eyes met Hashimoto&apos;s.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed inevitable that the welcome party would be between just the two of us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;By the way, what exactly does she mean by &apos;adventure&apos;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t worry about it, man. You should only listen to about half, no, maybe one-fifth of what Morishita says. Taking her seriously is just a waste of time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While expressing his astonishment, he gently pushed my back and started walking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This depressing atmosphere isn&apos;t good for the body. Let&apos;s move, shall we?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Being led by Hashimoto, I left the classroom.</p>",
