I was very scared.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was so scared, I couldn&apos;t help it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While continuing the conflict in my mind, I looked at my hands&#x2014;at both of my palms.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They were trembling.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just imagining it made my body tremble.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wanted to stop thinking about it, to reject it entirely.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>But&#x2026; But still&#x2014;I must confirm Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s true intentions.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I couldn&apos;t just give up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After all, I had yet to hear him speak about his true objectives from his own lips.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wouldn&apos;t be too late to make all the decisions after receiving that confirmation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He might&apos;ve been burdened with something he couldn&apos;t tell us about.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&#x2026;Let&apos;s confirm it.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With only those feelings to rely on,&#xa0;I stood up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Horikita-san.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if waiting for me to move, Hirata-kun, who had approached at some point, spoke.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou-kun and others were also looking this way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but can we talk later? I&apos;m going to meet him now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I don&apos;t have the luxury to be distracted by unnecessary chatter right now.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I left without even taking my bag, and with just my phone in hand, I headed to the hallway.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A fair amount of time had passed since the chime signaling the end of the school day rang.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I stepped into the hallway, many students had already started to leave.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Immediately, I sensed something unusual from the atmosphere of the other classes&apos; students around me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t know whether there had been an announcement from each class&apos;s teachers, but at least, everyone in our year already knew about Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s class transfer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The curious glances directed at me attested to that.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, those glances might&apos;ve held various implications and speculations regarding my class&apos;s situation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The theory that he was sent as a spy to the other class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The theory that he was exiled from the class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The theory that he betrayed us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Those might&apos;ve just been part of the countless baseless rumors and mere speculations flying around.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But that didn&apos;t matter now.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Before worrying about others&#x2019; thoughts, I didn&#x2019;t even understand the thoughts of my own class, or those belonging to Ayanokouji-kun himself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without any regard for manners, I forcefully opened the door to Sakayanagi-san&apos;s&#xa0;former class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>If he&apos;s still here&#x2014;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was what I was thinking, but&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While searching for him, I unconsciously counted the desks.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although Sakayanagi-san was supposed to have withdrawn voluntarily, the number of seats hadn&apos;t decreased.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, more importantly, only a few male and female students remained in the classroom, and Ayanokouji-kun wasn&apos;t among them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Tsukasaki-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I approached Tsukasaki-kun, who&#xa0;happened to be nearest.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do you need something?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You know why I&apos;m here, right? Where is Ayanokouji-kun?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He left the classroom a few minutes ago. He probably went to Keyaki Mall.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see, thank you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then there was no more need for me to stay here.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As I returned to the hallway, I immediately noticed some students smirking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was clear to them that we were in the midst of trouble, which was unpleasant.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">While walking quickly down the hallway, I tried to contact Ayanokouji-kun on my phone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The phone rang, but no matter how long I waited, there was no sign of him answering.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Either he didn&apos;t notice, or he noticed and chose not to answer.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Horikita-san.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was Matsushita-san who called out to me as I was heading toward the stairwell.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but I&apos;m in a hurry.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I know. You&apos;re going to see Ayanokouji-kun, right? Let me come with you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Matsushita-san lined up beside me, matching my pace without stopping.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why would you come?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;I want to know the reason behind Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s transfer. Just to confirm once more, this isn&apos;t part of your strategy, Horikita-san, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Unfortunately, I have no such plan. Even if transferring him to Ryuuen-kun&apos;s class would make strategic sense, there&apos;s hardly any point in dropping him to Class C. Now that Sakayanagi-san has left, there&apos;s no meaning in joining that class.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Right. So, Ayanokouji-kun decided to transfer without telling anyone.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t know. Whether someone asked him to, or he was threatened&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Or perhaps his heart was swayed by a large amount of funds&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Such thoughts crossed my mind, and my brain quickly understood that they were nearly impossible.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At least, he wasn&apos;t the kind of person to be swayed by funds, and it was unlikely that someone of his caliber would decide to transfer just because he was threatened.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was an unpleasant reality I didn&apos;t want to consider.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That meant that, indeed, this transfer was a decision Ayanokouji-kun made on his own.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The worst-case scenario floated to the surface of my mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Right now&#x2026; I don&apos;t want to talk based on mere speculation. Not until I hear it directly from him. So, it would be better if you wait&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;d like to, but I also want to hear the explanation directly from Ayanokouji-kun. He must have some sort of objective that&apos;ll convince us&#x2026; I want to hear it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Yes, that&apos;s exactly it.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I, too, wanted an answer that would have me convinced.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He didn&apos;t talk about much with me, or rather, to anyone around him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was why he was sometimes misunderstood as incompetent, and some even resented him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But the truth was different.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even if he found it troublesome, he cared about the class and lent a hand when we were in need.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was why I was certain that he must&apos;ve had some objective he hadn&apos;t told us about.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>He must&apos;ve sensed some anomaly or danger in Sakayanagi-san&apos;s&#xa0;former class, which only seemed to be sinking.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Or perhaps&#x2026; he might&apos;ve received some huge threat.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>That&apos;s why he went in alone, without telling his allies.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Such&#x2026; behaviors, like those belonging to a hero in a movie.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, all this speculation contained much of my wishful thinking, but&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But that wasn&apos;t the only thing that mattered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I would&apos;ve wanted him to consult with us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Whatever reason he had for deciding the transfer&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Leaving the class without saying anything&#x2026; that&#x2019;s just&#x2026; that&#x2019;s just&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji-kun&#x2026; Why&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&#x2026;Am I really that unreliable?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Such foolishness&#x2026; &quot; <em>&#x2026;Yes, that&apos;s right.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even as I internally asked myself that question, I couldn&#x2019;t help but let out a bitter smile.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To him, I still must&apos;ve seemed like a child.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t possess the qualifications to stand beside him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no way he&#x2019;d rely on me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;Horikita-san, are you okay?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m&#x2026; fine.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Matsushita-san looked at me, worried; I wondered if my almost voiceless response reached her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;More importantly, it&apos;s about Ayanokouji-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The class transfer had already been officially decided.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, there was still a good chance that this wasn&apos;t his intention.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If that was the case, I absolutely had to save him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t just me. The whole class had to come together and scrape up Private Points for his sake.</p>",
