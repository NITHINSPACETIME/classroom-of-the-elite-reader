Terrible taste. Only middle school boys would use that.]</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And this time, I sent back a slightly mean reply.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sweet talk wasn&apos;t the only important thing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Maybe I should reveal why I was here today.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wandered around the store by myself, but in fact, there was another person walking a different route from me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It went without saying&#x2026; it was my boyfriend, Ayanokouji Kiyotaka. Super cool and both smart and athletic.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>It&apos;s almost as if he stepped out of a manga&#x2026;</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe I&apos;m praising him too much&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I corrected myself after saying it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After all, I wasn&apos;t exactly good at relationships.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ahem, anyway, this was a way we could hold a mock date. We would arrive at the meeting place separately and then wander around the store independently.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If someone else heard about it, they would surely ask, &apos;What&apos;s that?&apos; But this was an attempt to enjoy dating while keeping our relationship a secret.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Well&#x2026; I guess people would say, &apos;Just go public with your relationship with Kiyotaka,&apos; but it&apos;s okay for now.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>[What should we do next?]</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>[Can we look around a bit more?]</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After our exchange, I wandered around the store.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yes, nobody noticed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was true. It was because we each came to the store separately and looked at different things.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, I felt happy that he was nearby, but at the same time, I really wanted to talk directly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To communicate with our words, our eyes, and our touching hands. That was the essence of dating I had in mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After that, we left the general store and killed time by visiting supermarkets and bookstores, changing places and browsing different items.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a fun but lonely date.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t think the attempt was a failure, but it was complicated&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I really wanted to date Kiyotaka openly and proudly as soon as possible. Yes, that was what I thought once again, with a renewed conviction.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And then&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was around 7:30 that evening.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was watching TV in my room when I sat up at the sound of a knock.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t the chime, but a light knock.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wondered who it could be, but I couldn&apos;t hear any voices.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Feeling a bit curious, I opened the front door&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was a small paper bag with pink patterns placed on the hallway floor. There was no one around.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Feeling curious, I picked it up and brought it inside.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>It&apos;s for me, right?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Before opening it, I touched it from the top.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hmm, could this be&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had an inkling of what it might&apos;ve been, so I took the item out of the bag&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was a small kitten strap with a ribbon.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Seeing it, I couldn&apos;t help but laugh.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He really is simple-minded.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>If you think something like this will make you popular, you&apos;re totally mistaken</em>.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I removed all the other straps and attached the kitten strap to my cell phone, smiling.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not satisfied with just this.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I spent the rest of the day looking at the strap.</p>",
