Although Ichinose&apos;s class had a slight advantage due to the number difference, Horikita&apos;s class still had a good chance at winning the full-class battle, and depending on how well they had seen through each other in the small-group battle and the penalty point applications, it could go either way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was supposed to be a close and intense battle.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The tense atmosphere was about to become heavier with Chabashira&apos;s next words.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Unfortunately&#x2026; three of the five you chose were targeted by the opponent&apos;s penalty points. Your second selection, &apos;Wan Mei-Yui,&apos; your third selection, &apos;Yukimura Teruhiko,&apos; and your fourth selection, &apos;Kouenji Rokusuke,&apos; will each have twenty-five points deducted from their exam results. On the other hand, your correctly assigned penalty points on the opponent&apos;s small-group battle are their second selection, &apos;Kanzaki Ryuuji,&apos; and their third selection, &apos;Tsube Hitomi,&apos; each of whom will have ten points deducted.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Twenty-five points for three people&#x2026;!? That much&#x2026;!?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The situation was indeed dire. A twenty-five-point difference was almost enough to bring students from academic levels A and D to the same level.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Did they use their Private Points to apply a large number of penalty points?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Unfortunately, information about how many additional penalty points the opponent purchased isn&apos;t disclosed. All we know is that three people were targeted for the penalty application.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If twenty-five penalty points were applied to ten people each, then they&apos;d need a total of 250 penalty points.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Subtracting the initial 100 penalty points given, they&apos;d have to prepare 150 more points out of pocket, costing a total of 7.5 million Private Points.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even the assumption that they were applying the penalty points to just ten people involved a somewhat unrealistic sum of Private Points.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If it was hard to imagine such a large investment, the next thought that came to mind was&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey, Hirata. I don&apos;t want to think about it, but could this mean there was a leak?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sudou interpreted and accepted the reality he faced.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t deny it&#x2026; But I only spoke about who I&apos;d assign with a few people&#x2014;the people I talked to in order to help decide who to pick and the actual participants. Oh, and also Horikita-san.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In selecting the five for the small-group battle this time, Horikita had entrusted Hirata with the responsibility, judging that she couldn&apos;t make a calm decision by herself. Hirata wasn&apos;t the type to decide alone, so he had discussions with a few key people and selected the five participants. Needless to say, the selection of these five classmates was top secret, and they had tight control over the information to prevent leaks.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then it must be one of them.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No&#x2026; I can&apos;t imagine that happening.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But look at the people who were assigned, no one would normally choose Kouenji. He&apos;s not the type to actively participate, and our opponent knows that&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As he began to speak, Sudou realized one possibility.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Could it be Kouenji? You informed the participants beforehand, didn&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kouenji showed no reaction to the question, but soon Hirata interjected, denying the possibility.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s not possible. I hadn&apos;t told Kouenji-kun in advance that I&#x2019;d chosen him. I only told him that he might be chosen as a participant.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">During the discussions, it was decided that excluding Kouenji from the small-group battle from the start would only be welcomed by&#xa0;the opponent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From Ike to Kouenji, it was important to thoroughly examine and carefully select from everyone available.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Eventually, they concluded that choosing Kouenji would catch the opponent off guard. Kouenji didn&apos;t follow anyone&apos;s instructions, but he had been relatively serious about past written exams.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The small-group battle was merely an extension of the full-class battle, and it didn&#x2019;t require any extra work for the selected individuals.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Therefore, they assumed that Kouenji would receive a reasonably high score without much effort.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The fact that he was targeted as a nominee was completely unexpected.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then why? No matter how you think about it, this is&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It can&#x2019;t be because our information got leaked, right? After all, the other two weren&apos;t targeted. If it&#x2019;d been completely leaked, it wouldn&apos;t be strange if everyone had been selected for penalty points. There&apos;s no need to deliberately leave out those two.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kushida pointed this out to Sudou, who didn&apos;t want to take on the exam while harboring doubts.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;That&apos;s true, isn&apos;t it&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then did Ichinose-san guess the three people correctly only using pure speculation? That&#x2019;s amazing&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Alongside this, there was also her boldness in assigning twenty-five penalty points each.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Many of their classmates, including Shinohara, were surprised by this unconventional method.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">All except for one person.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2026;I don&apos;t&#x2026; think that&apos;s it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was almost like Karuizawa was muttering to herself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you mean &apos;I don&apos;t think that&apos;s it,&apos; Kei-chan?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From a distant seat, Satou voiced her confusion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe&#x2026; it wasn&apos;t Ichinose-san who saw through them&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She paused for a moment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Saying that name made her feel heavy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That happy scene <em>those two </em>had this morning lingered in her mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was why Karuizawa reached a single conclusion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Could it be Ayanokouji-kun?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a classmate from not long ago.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hearing that name, Ike raised his voice with slight irritation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Huh? Why Ayanokouji? He&apos;s in Class C and has nothing to do with us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We, Class A, are enemies even from Class C&apos;s perspective, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With emotionless eyes, Karuizawa looked toward Ike.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Feeling an unusual intensity in her gaze, Ike caught his breath.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well&#x2026; maybe&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hirata felt as if the tangled threads were unraveling upon hearing Karuizawa&apos;s words.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s possible&#x2026; He was in the same class as us for two years. He would understand better than anyone how the state of the class is and who might be chosen. He knew that Kouenji-kun had a positive attitude towards the written exams, so it&apos;s not surprising that he was targeted.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If that&apos;s the case, then Ayanokouji really is the worst&#x2026;!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We shouldn&apos;t jump to conclusions. Whether the information had been leaked or Ayanokouji-kun had been involved, it&apos;s all just speculation. We have no choice but to fight with the hand we&apos;re dealt.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They were already crushed by despair before the exam even started.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yet, they had to overcome this handicap and win.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, everyone&#x2026; It&apos;s because I&#x2026; couldn&apos;t do anything&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Horikita voiced her regrets and apologized.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She intensely loathed herself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If she had been more reliable, perhaps the situation might&apos;ve changed a bit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We haven&apos;t lost yet. Even if we&apos;re at a disadvantage, if we refuse to give up and continue fighting, we should still have a chance.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without panicking, Hirata calmly conveyed the situation. Lowering their motivation here would do more harm than good. The points they could gain wouldn&apos;t increase, but they could certainly decrease&#x2026;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Soon, Chabashira announced the start of the special exam.</p>",
