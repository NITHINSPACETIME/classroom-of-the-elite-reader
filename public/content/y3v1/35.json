The results were to be announced on the same day, so many students were visibly restless.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ichinose slowly looked around the class, analyzing the expressions of each student, and felt hopeful about the upcoming results. They weren&apos;t sure about the outcome of the full-class battle, but in the small-group battle, their assigned penalty points went better than anyone had anticipated.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Their odds of winning, which were around fifty percent, must have risen to over seventy afterward&#x2014;that was what she predicted.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, they couldn&apos;t let their guard down until the very end.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was still the possibility that Horikita&apos;s class, despite multiple twenty-point handicaps, could still get multiple high scores or achieve more than expected in the full-class battle.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They had high expectations and a bit of anxiety.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, the moment Hoshinomiya entered the classroom, the anxieties were immediately swept away from the whole class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a characteristic typical of Hoshinomiya, which couldn&apos;t really be called a strong or a weak point, that made the result evident.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Before even announcing the results, her expression had already softened significantly, and she could hardly contain her joy, making the outcome obvious to everyone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Everyone, sorry to keep you waiting. The results of the special exam are in, and I&apos;d like to announce them!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yesss! We did it!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shibata prematurely took his victory stance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey, I haven&apos;t said anything yet~?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I mean, it&apos;s clear as day, isn&apos;t it?! We did it, we did it!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shibata pointed out how her atmosphere made it obvious and started hopping around, but Hoshinomiya&apos;s cheeks remained relaxed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Shibata-kun&apos;s become really cheerful lately. I mean, isn&apos;t it a bit too much? It&#x2019;s like he&#x2019;s a new person.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kobashi and the person who sat in front of her, Iizuka, started whispering about Shibata.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Look, there was that heartbreak&#x2026; It&apos;s not like he&apos;s despairing, but maybe he can&apos;t hold himself together without acting cheerful.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah~ And it&apos;s not just Shibata-kun, right? Well, it can&apos;t be helped~&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Can you believe that Honami-chan made a public confession? Eh, wait, is she already dating Ayanokouji-kun?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t know, but they&apos;ve been coming to school together a lot lately, so maybe they are?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hmm&#x2026; I mean, I guess Ayanokouji-kun is cool and all, but still, for him to win over Honami-chan&#x2026; I wonder what kind of interaction they had.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Iizuka looked at Ichinose and nodded in admiration.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Shh, don&apos;t stare too much, or they&apos;ll notice. The boys are all tense about that matter right now. It&apos;s better not to make a fuss.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But I&apos;m curious about Karuizawa-san and stuff&#x2026; Should I ask?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No way. That kind of thing is, you know, tactless.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Okay, everyone, focus on the results~&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As the students started getting noisy, Hoshinomiya lightly called out to them and cleared her throat.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, she operated the tablet, and the results were displayed.</p><div class=\"text-block\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&#x203b; The winners of each match will be bolded</em></p></div><div class=\"text-block\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>Class A vs. Class D:</strong></p><div class=\"text-block\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Full-Class Battle:</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Class A &#x2014; 2633 pts vs. <strong>Class D &#x2014; 2712 pts</strong></p></div><div class=\"text-block\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Small-Group Battles:</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">1: Sudou Ken &#x2014; 66 pts vs. <strong>Himeno Yuki &#x2014; 69 pts</strong>&#xa0;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">2: Wan Mei-Yui &#x2014; 82 pts (Penalty 25) vs. <strong>Kanzaki Ryuuji &#x2014; 75 pts (Penalty 10)</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">3: Yukimura Teruhiko &#x2014; 84 pts (Penalty 25) vs <strong>Tsube Hitomi &#x2014; 77 pts (Penalty 10)</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">4: <strong>Mori Nene &#x2014; 69 pts</strong>&#xa0;vs. Kobashi Yume &#x2014; 68 pts</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">5: Kouenji Rokusuke &#x2014; 72 pts (Penalty 25) vs.<strong>&#xa0;Beppu Ryouta &#x2014; 71 pts</strong></p></div></div><div class=\"text-block\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>Class B vs. Class C:</strong></p><div class=\"text-block\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Full-Class Battle:</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Class B &#x2014; 2327 pts vs. <strong>Class C &#x2014; 2880 pts</strong></p></div><div class=\"text-block\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>Small-Group Battles:</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">1: <strong>Ishizaki Daichi &#x2014; 40 pts </strong>vs. Ayanokouji Kiyotaka 100 pts (Penalty 100)</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">2: Yabu Nanami &#x2014; 47 pts vs.<strong>&#xa0;Shimazaki Ikkei &#x2014; 81 pts</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">3: Ibuki Mio &#x2014; 43 pts vs.<strong>&#xa0;Fukuyama Shinobu &#x2014; 79 pts</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">4: Kondou Reon &#x2014; 47 pts vs. <strong>Sanada Kousei &#x2014; 83 pts</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">5: Kinoshita Minori &#x2014; 50 pts vs. <strong>Sawada Yasumi &#x2014; 80 pts</strong></p></div></div><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Both leaders, Horikita and Ichinose, were wary that they&apos;d get targeted by the penalty points, so they didn&apos;t participate in the small-group battles. Class A opted for a strategy that paired top students with those with moderate abilities, including unexpected combinations like Sudou and Kouenji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">On the other hand, Class D primarily chose their participants from those who were a bit above average within their class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Looking at the results alone, both of the upper two classes were defeated, but Class D didn&apos;t win by a large margin. Few would consider it an easy victory.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It was scary, but I&apos;m glad we bought the penalty points.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ichinose gave a nod at Amikura&apos;s happy tone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Aside from the three who were accurately targeted within the small-group participants, twenty-five penalty points were also designated to Hirata Yousuke and Kushida Kikyou, which meant that Ichinose and her class had to pay an additional 1.25 million Private Points out of their own pockets to get the required additional penalty points. Although it was a significant expense, when divided amongst forty people, each person only had to be burdened with paying 31,250 Private Points, which wasn&#x2019;t too taxing on the wallet. Plus, with their monthly income increasing by ten thousand Private Points due to their victory, they&apos;d recover their investment in four months with some to spare.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Congratulations, everyone. We definitely had to defeat Class A, and we did it splendidly!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&#xa0;Even though they anticipated the outcome, the class erupted in joy as it was confirmed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We did it, Honami-chan! We won, we won!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The nearby girls also exploded with joy along with their teacher&apos;s words.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Phew. That&apos;s a relief. It feels like a weight&apos;s been lifted off my shoulders.&quot; Ichinose shared her joy with Shiranami who sat beside her, exchanging high-fives.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Seeing the students&apos; joyous expressions, their homeroom teacher Hoshinomiya also nodded happily.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes, yes. As your homeroom teacher, I&apos;m very satisfied with the result. Of course, there&apos;s still a big gap, so we need to stay focused and keep working hard~&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;By the way&#x2026; I thought that Ayanokouji was the only one who ended up losing, but he actually scored perfectly on that test!?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There were some really difficult questions, right? I didn&apos;t even understand some of the questions&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As surprise arose in their classroom, Kobashi and Iizuka looked at each other.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">One particular thought had struck them&#x2014;&apos;<em>Is this why!?</em>&apos;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The quiet, handsome boy who&#x2019;s been hiding his abilities&#x2026; Ah, this is why, Kobashi-san&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;This is why, Iizuka-san&#x2026; surely this is why&#x2026; Honami-chan knew this&#x2026;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The two joined their hands together, interpreted things their own way, and repeatedly nodded at each other with sparkling eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Unaware of their conversation, Ichinose took out her phone and sent a message to Ayanokouji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>[&#x2018;Getting a perfect score sure is amazing. It&apos;s a pity that some of the penalty points were wasted, but I&apos;m glad Class C could win. Our class also won thanks to you, Ayanokouji-kun. As expected, Kouenji-kun showed up, and Horikita-san didn&apos;t participate. Thank you so much.&apos;]</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As soon as she sent it, the message was read, and a reply came back.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>[&apos;It&apos;s thanks to your courage in choosing to trust in my advice that you won.&apos;]</em>&#xa0; Ichinose couldn&apos;t help but smile at such a humble reply.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, since they were still technically in class, she decided not to continue the conversation and immediately turned off her phone.</p>",
