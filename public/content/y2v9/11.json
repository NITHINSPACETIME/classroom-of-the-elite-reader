Some people saw me as a rival—and the more intense that feeling was, the more they loathed me. But that didn’t really matter. Good or bad, I was happy as long as the common riffraff recognized that I was special. It had always been the same for me—I’d followed the dazzling path of Mr. Popular all throughout elementary school and junior high. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Even so, I’d never been able to shake off this odd, niggling discomfort I sometimes felt, like something was wrong. A feeling of unease that I couldn’t answer. My life had always been free of inconvenience, and that feeling was the only thing that had smoldered there in the back of my mind for all this time. Even after being recognized by so many, after being followed by them, that feeling that something was off wouldn’t go away.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">But I had decided not to care. Everything was fine, regardless of this feeling of unease, as long as I was still popular, still number one. That was how it was supposed to be…</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">But things changed completely once I entered high school. I couldn’t stop that sense of unease from boiling furiously to the surface. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Horikita Manabu. That student was one year older than me, and he had commanded the respect of many. He outshone me by far; he was much wiser than I was, and he had conviction, too, without ever seeming fickle.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Then there was another person. He was different from Horikita Manabu, but he had special talents. Ayanokouji Kiyotaka. He was an unusual guy with a cocky attitude, but even so, his abilities were undeniably the real thing.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">My own accomplishments weren’t any less impressive than the achievements of those two were.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">But, along with that feeling of unease I couldn’t banish, there was something that I sometimes thought about.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Am I really that good?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Or am I simply the emperor with no clothes, unlucky enough never to have been graced with a real opponent?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The thought plagued me. It was the source of my unease.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">That was why I needed to settle things—in order to eliminate that feeling. I had to defeat Ayanokouji, and become someone truly gifted. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Otherwise…</span></p>\r\n",
