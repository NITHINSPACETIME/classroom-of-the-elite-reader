Happy New Year! It’s Kinugasa. I sincerely hope this year is a good one for you, too. Last year was certainly hectic, with lots of things happening that kept me busy, and the second season of the anime. With the third season in the works for this year, I hope that 2023 is even going to be a little exciting.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">On a personal note, I’ve come up with a routine for my weekday activities lately, where I choose one café out of about three or so potential candidates in the morning and head over there. I don’t get enough exercise working at my desk, so I walk or bike there. I stay out until just before noon, racking my brain, trying to come up with ideas, hemming and hawing, and then return home. I hole up in my workplace until night, and then go to sleep. I repeat this process five times a week, over and over and over.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">On my days off, I spend half the day working, and the other half of the day playing with my kids. Weekdays pass by in the blink of an eye, but weekends feel about three times longer, which is tough… But surprisingly, I seem to come up with more interesting ideas at times like that.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">One problem I’ve been having recently is that once I catch a cold, it seems to take a long time before it goes away. I’ve had a cough and a runny nose since before Christmas, and I can’t seem to get rid of them. I’m still not seeing any sign of them going away yet, since both over-the-counter drugs and treatments from the hospital have only been partially effective in dealing with them… The cough is especially bad. When I get into a bad coughing fit while out at the supermarket or shopping or whatever, even though I’m wearing a mask, I still feel so embarrassed and sorry for everyone else. Get warm outside already, and let me be healthy, dang it!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Now, getting to talking about the main story. With this issue, Volume 9, the long second-semester story has come to an end. I would like to offer sincere thanks to those of you who have stuck with me until now. I would be very grateful if you would continue to stick with me, even if it’s just from force of habit.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ayanokouji, and the rest of the characters too, are now preparing for their third semester and looking ahead to the third year. I humbly ask that you please understand in advance that the third semester story may be a little crueler and more rigorous than the second semester in terms of content.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">In keeping with what’s been done in the past, the next volume will be a winter-vacation story. Considering that, for the time being, moments of comfort may become fewer, the gentle (probably) winter-vacation volume may be a worthwhile story. Though we’re parting again for a short while, I sincerely look forward to meeting once more before the summer.</span></p>\r\n",
