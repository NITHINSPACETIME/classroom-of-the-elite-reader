It was just as I was thinking of suggesting we get lunch in a little while.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Actually, there&apos;s one more reason I called you here. And I was lucky enough to find her.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Huh? Whaddya mean?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To the head-tilting Karuizawa-san, I simply directed my gaze in that direction and had her follow.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Amasawa-san?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She muttered the name upon spotting the back of a lone student with red twin-tails walking ahead of us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Amasawa Ichika-san has a connection to Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s past. That&apos;s why I&apos;m investigating her right now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ahh... So that&apos;s how it is.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Next to me, Karuizawa-san showed no surprise, but rather a look of understanding.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Did you perhaps know about their relationship?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nah, not at all. But I&apos;ve seen Ayanokouji-kun and Amasawa-san talking a little bit. I kinda had a feeling it wasn&apos;t just some simple senpai-and-kouhai relationship they made at this school.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It didn&apos;t seem like there was a difference in the information we had, but her opinion was reassuring.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The fact that we sensed the same thing gave me encouragement to continue with the tedious investigation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are we gonna tail her now? Hey, should we?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...You seem awfully excited about this.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t mind doing spy-like stuff. I mean, is there anyone who actually dislikes it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Well, if I thought of it as an extension of a game, perhaps it wouldn&apos;t be so bad...</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Our target likely had a connection to Ayanokouji-kun and moreover, she was considerably skilled.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Knowing that there was a high probability of losing our only lead if we failed, I found it impossible to enjoy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;For now, I&apos;ll tell you what I&apos;ve gleaned from observing Amasawa-san lately.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was something I&apos;d noticed from watching Amasawa-san after school over the past few days.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She usually acted alone most of the time, and I never saw her spending time with classmates or friends. Of course, she would respond with a smile if spoken to by anyone, boy or girl, but she would immediately return to being alone and would never join the group that had approached her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It appeared to be her stance not to form any particularly close relationships.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That preference for solitude seemed somewhat similar to Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s, but perhaps that was a stretch. In his case, it wasn&apos;t that he didn&apos;t make friends; if anything, he was the type who couldn&apos;t, even if he wanted to.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That was an act... No, it couldn&apos;t have been, could it? Surely not.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I don&apos;t think that was an act. That similarity seems like another thing they have in common.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Setting aside how pathetic it was that I hadn&apos;t known that about him, his way of interacting with people really wasn&apos;t very skillful. That was probably his true self.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Time passed as we continued to follow Amasawa-san&apos;s back from a distance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ideally, I should&apos;ve spoken with her directly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But the world wasn&apos;t so kind that she would talk honestly just like that.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Another person, this time a male student, called out to Amasawa-san.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They only spoke for about five seconds and it appeared to be little more than a greeting.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even so, I made a point to remember every student who was on speaking terms with her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Gathering information indirectly was the only thing I could do at the moment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as I was memorizing his face, the phone I held in my right hand vibrated.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s up?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hold on.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>[&apos;I&apos;m waiting in the Student Council room.&apos;]</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I took out my phone, looked at the text on the screen and tilted my head in my mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Who could this be?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Such a short message, from an unregistered contact.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no date or time specified, but did that mean right now...?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If my two o&apos;clock appointment today had been moved up, it wouldn&apos;t have been strange to get word from Nanase-san. Was this something else, then? Even as I was lost in thought, Amasawa-san continued to walk through Keyaki Mall.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though I knew I had to follow her, I blanked my phone&apos;s screen and closed my eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I suppose it can&apos;t be helped...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As long as I&apos;d been entrusted with the position of student council president, I couldn&apos;t just act on personal feelings alone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If someone was waiting in the student council room, I had a duty to respond as best as I could.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Or, even if there was a 99% chance it wasn&apos;t, it might have been from Ayanokouji-kun.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As a realistic possibility, it might also have been part of the next special exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I know it&apos;s sudden, but I have to go to the student council.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I apologized for having to cut things short before we could even have lunch, despite being the one who invited her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t worry about it at all. And hey, I won&apos;t go tailing Amasawa-san on my own, so don&apos;t you worry.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Realizing on her own what I was about to warn her against, Karuizawa-san replied accordingly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I apologized to her one more time and then decided to head for school.</p>",
