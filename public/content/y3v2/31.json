Although Hashimoto knew a lot about the class, there seemed to be many things that only girls could see, and I was able to hear a few useful stories that made me nod in agreement.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">About an hour passed since we started chatting, and the caf&#xe9; gradually grew more crowded as evening approached.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as I started to consider wrapping things up&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Crap... Ayanokouji again...?!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A voice exclaimed, and the pair who arrived at the next table turned to us with a look of dismay.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was Ike and Hondou, whom I ran into at the school cafeteria yesterday afternoon.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;re fated to meet.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">At my reply, he narrowed his eyes, his displeasure obvious.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you mean, &apos;fated to meet&apos;?! Don&apos;t act so familiar, you traitor.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Disgust oozed from his expression. I thought they would immediately move to another table, like at the cafeteria, but with few empty seats available, the two of them sat down reluctantly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Seeing the Class A students, Hashimoto deliberately chose to act casual.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;re in different classes, but we&apos;re still students at the same school, so let&apos;s get along, eh? Or are you planning to complain every time you see his face?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not like I mean to... but you can see why I&apos;m pissed, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ike and his friend, not wanting to direct their frustration at Hashimoto, glanced over and glared at me again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why&apos;re you so bent out of shape about it? It&apos;s not like Ayanokouji transferred from C to A. Just changing classes had no effect on your Class Points. It&apos;s not like it cost you anything out of your own pockets. And besides, you guys are the almighty Class A, aren&apos;t ya?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though it was a struggle, he tried to flatter them to somehow reduce their pointless frustration.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, we&apos;re Class A, but Ayanokouji hid how smart he was. That&apos;s pretty much like betraying the class from the start, ain&apos;t it? And then the second he transferred, bam, a perfect score. I&apos;ve never seen such a nasty move.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I produced proper results in the latter half of my time in Horikita&apos;s class, but perhaps for Ike and the others, that was also part of the problem.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And besides&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Seemingly with more to complain about, Ike averted his gaze from Hashimoto and looked at me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m hearing all sorts of nasty rumors, y&apos;know. That you intentionally set up both Sakura and Maezono to get expelled from the very beginning. Don&apos;t tell me... You didn&apos;t get Haruki expelled too, did you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A former friend of ours. The name of a student who&apos;d been especially close to Ike and Sudou came up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Haruki? Who&apos;s that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if the name didn&apos;t ring a bell, Hashimoto looked blankly and tilted his head a little to the left.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yamauchi Haruki!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He slammed his hand on the table and shot to his feet. The cup shook from the impact, but thankfully, it didn&apos;t tip over.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ike had been complaining but remained calm until now, but it seemed that was an unexpected landmine.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yamauchi... Oh, ahh, right, there was a student with that name. My bad, my bad. He was in another class, so I totally forgot about him. But I remember now. Anyway, Sakayanagi was the one who did that, right? Ayanokouji had nothin&apos; to do with it, man. It&apos;s way outta line to blame him for every little thing.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Apologizing for having genuinely forgotten, Hashimoto hastily tried to calm him down.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ll never let a guy like you get me expelled, you hear me!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey, I said calm down, Ike. No need to go raising such a huge death flag for yourself. Nobody wins if we start trading barbs here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Seeing Ike&apos;s increasingly heated and uncontrollable attitude, even Hashimoto started to panic. He probably couldn&apos;t care less about what Ike and Hondou were feeling, but he knew this commotion wasn&apos;t good for his class.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He had to have heard about one of the possible rules for this special exam from Horikita, but I wondered if he really understood it. On the other hand, if this was all an act&#x2014;a strategy to drag down Class C&#x2014;then it might be worthy of praise, but it wasn&apos;t a clever method, as it also increased the risk of their own defeat. If he raised his voice any further and continued his belligerent attitude, he would inevitably be noticed and without a doubt be subject to a penalty.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Okay... Maybe I was overreacting a bit, but we in Class A have the right to complain this much. Just how much did they pay you to betray our class?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Their frustration built up considerably, partly due to their defeat in the last special exam.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That wasn&apos;t a problem that could be easily resolved by trying to smooth it over like Hashimoto did.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed it would be better if I just took the brunt of it and let them vent their anger.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Who can say. It might be twenty million, it might be thirty million. Unfortunately, I have no intention of revealing the exact figure to you here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was important for me to maintain a cold and detached response.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">By doing so, Ike and the other guy could direct their hatred toward me without any hesitation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And by bringing that back to their class, they could rally together, firmly united against a common enemy.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Above all, if I got worked up here, Class C would only be at a disadvantage. Even if the school was monitoring the situation with cameras or external observers, I wanted to paint a picture where Class A was the aggressor, and Class C was trying to settle things peacefully.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was unclear if the school was monitoring us that closely, but even if our daily behavior was unrelated to the exam, it was important to act with discipline like a proper student, as it had a small, yet not insignificant, effect on our monthly Class Points.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The teachers&apos; words to each class would surely be a good opportunity to make our classmates re-evaluate the importance of sticking to the fundamentals.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t you come crying to us later, regretting your decision and wanting to come back to our class.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After voicing his complaints one last time, the pair slightly distanced themselves as they returned to their seats.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They just sat down. I didn&apos;t want to make their caf&#xe9; time uncomfortable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Shouldn&apos;t we head back soon?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I called out to the three of them, picked up my nearly empty cup, and stood up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, good call. We&apos;ve said what we needed to.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto replied in agreement, and Morishita and Shiraishi followed suit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, after we left the caf&#xe9;, Hashimoto turned and glanced back toward Ike&apos;s group.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;All that complaining... Ike&apos;s completely getting worked up over nothing. The way he blames every little thing on Ayanokouji tells me the atmosphere in their class is still pretty damn heavy. They need to get their heads on straight already.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Logically speaking, that may be so, but I believe it would be better to cut them some slack. After all, if I were a student in Class A, I&apos;m sure I would be on edge in their current situation as well.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe so, but still. In the first place, Ayanokouji, was it really okay not to deny taking the money? That guy&apos;s gonna go around spreading all kinds of rumors, true or not.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter. It&apos;s already being whispered about as a rumor, anyway. The situation won&apos;t change just because it seems a little more plausible.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So you don&apos;t care what other people think of you, huh? Still, connecting it to the Yamauchi incident... that&apos;s a bit of a leap, to say the least.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As Hashimoto looked on, exasperated, Morishita turned a suspicious eye toward me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You never know. With a man like Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, you can never tell what he&apos;s doing behind the scenes. It&apos;s a long shot, I know, but he might have had a hand in it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nah, that&apos;s going too far. But if, on the off chance, it were true, that&apos;d make him one hell of a reliable ally. The stronger your allies are, the better, after all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter how things turned out, Hashimoto was determined to see it in a positive light.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you overestimate me, you&apos;ll only be more disappointed later.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then I&apos;ll gladly overestimate you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wanted to hedge my bets just in case, but it seemed he wasn&apos;t going to let me.</p>",
