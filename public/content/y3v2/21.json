To me, it looked like Maki-kun didn&apos;t want to admit defeat and prioritized his pride.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I suppose so. That&apos;s a possibility, but... at first, it definitely looked like he wanted to pin the heavier blame on Kusanagi-kun. So it&apos;s strange that he didn&apos;t pursue that slip of the tongue. He could have claimed that he deliberately held back, but Kusanagi-kun didn&apos;t stop attacking. Couldn&apos;t he have protected his pride that way, too?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I answered, Nanase-san closed her eyes as if deep in thought.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Or perhaps... I tried to think about it from another direction.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe... there&apos;s someone else involved in this assault case.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Thinking that, as I recalled their testimonies, I felt as if I was beginning to see a glimpse of the truth.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But Kusanagi-kun was the one who won the fight, wasn&apos;t he? If this was revenge, wouldn&apos;t it only make sense if Kusanagi-kun was the one who got the worst of it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It doesn&apos;t necessarily have to be revenge, does it? It&apos;s possible a third party punished Maki-kun for starting a fight and losing. Not that such a thing should be condoned, of course.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...I see. That&apos;s one way of looking at it. But then it doesn&apos;t explain why Kusanagi-kun wouldn&apos;t report it. Is it because he&apos;s afraid of becoming a target for the person who punished him... perhaps?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What I was just imagining is something similar to that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was understandable that if Maki-kun had been punished by someone like Ryuuen-kun or Housen-kun, even the winner, Kusanagi-kun, would lack the courage to speak up. But it was hard to imagine that they would go all the way to the first-year dorms just for a trivial squabble between freshmen. Besides, if there&apos;d been such a vicious intervention from an upperclassman, there was no way they would&apos;ve so brazenly tried to blame each other in the student council room; they would&apos;ve been instructed to act remorseful and get through the matter without further incident.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Those two showed no signs of anything like that, and what came across for certain was that they were both confident in their fighting skills and very proud. However, they were also unwilling to tell the whole story. I could surmise that much.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But Student Council President&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I know. As far as I&apos;m aware, there aren&apos;t any boys among this year&apos;s first-years who rule their surroundings with violence and fear like Ryuuen-kun or Housen-kun. That&apos;s what you were about to say, wasn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. I can&apos;t think of a single male student who stands out enough to be ruling his class through fear.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Were they just good at hiding, or was it something else...</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I looked through the documents I received from Nanase-san again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Should I try to hear from the first witness who found the two injured...?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Or should I call in Maki-kun and Kusanagi-kun again, after they&apos;ve had more time to cool off?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was also the option of speaking to them individually, but I had a feeling that carelessly wounding their pride wouldn&apos;t lead to a solution.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Say, Nanase-san. Boys can be a bit childish in the way they think, don&apos;t you agree?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hm, yes, I suppose so. I do think they have that side to them, to some extent. In fact, the two of them acted like children the entire time they were in the student council room.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes. The problem is, both Kusanagi-kun and Maki-kun think they&apos;re strong. That&apos;s exactly why they were only concerned about who won or lost the fight, refusing to back down an inch and trying to pin all the blame on each other, even in a place where they could be punished by the student council.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What if someone took on both of them at the same time, two boys who are confident in their fighting skills?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You mean their pride was wounded because they lost a two-on-one fight? It&apos;s not out of the question, but would they really be that tight-lipped about it? Couldn&apos;t they have worked together to pin the blame on that single person?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But what if their opponent wasn&apos;t a boy... but a girl... and just one at that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Nanase-san, who was listening beside me, looked at me with a startled expression.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That could be it. For two boys who are boasting and insisting they didn&apos;t lose the fight, I can see why they&apos;d be too embarrassed to admit they lost to a high school girl.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This matter could be closed, since the two boys were accepting of their punishment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, if a third party was involved in this fight, that was a clear act of assault.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Considering their future here at school, this was a problem I wanted to correct now.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Since neither of them is filing a complaint, we have no choice but to investigate. Nanase-san, if you&apos;re willing, could you help me uncover the truth?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course, Student Council President. But being the president is a lot of work, isn&apos;t it? You&apos;re amazing, Horikita-senpai.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m nothing special. I was told I was exceptional quite often back in middle school, but... Ayanokouji-kun, my brother, Nagumo-senpai... no, Sakayanagi-san and Ichinose-san are the same. Watching them up close, I&apos;m always made keenly aware of it. To people like them, I&apos;m... undoubtedly just another mediocre person...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was pathetic self-deprecation, but I voiced what I honestly felt.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps it was because the way Koenji-kun so easily brushed me off after school was still weighing heavily on my mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For some reason, Nanase-san&apos;s eyes widened in slight surprise as she stared intently at me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What...?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No&#x2014;mediocre. Even so, I think that&apos;s fine. A mediocre Horikita-senpai isn&apos;t bad at all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hmph... You know, hearing that repeatedly is starting to get on my nerves.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter how I looked at it, it sounded as though she were making a fool of me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;W-Wha&#x2014;!? I-I&apos;m so sorry! I think Student Council President Horikita is very admirable!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Nanase-san lost her composure, looking truly panicked.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s too late to try and smooth things over now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After pretending to be angry, I smiled and gently placed my hand on her shoulder.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;ll need you to lend me your strength for a while.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Y-Yes. Of course.&quot;</p>",
