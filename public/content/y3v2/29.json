Let me continue what we were talking about this morning.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I have plans, so I must decline. Please try not to cry, even if you&apos;re hurt.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Morishita, who sat behind me, rejected Hashimoto&apos;s invitation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not asking you... I&apos;m talking to Ayanokouji, Ayanokouji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I expected this would happen ever since our conversation was interrupted this morning, but at this rate, the opportunity to head to the library was slipping further away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Should I turn him down once and prioritize meeting Hiyori?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No... we already entered the exam period.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If that was the case, for the sake of sound class management, I should probably put off showing my face at the completely private library. There was a chance I could still meet her after this discussion was over.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Shall we change locations?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That sounds like a good idea. Seems like a troublesome phantom&apos;s latched onto your back, Ayanokouji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I followed Hashimoto, who urged me to get up from my seat, and we headed for the hallway.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shiraishi, who&apos;d been there in the morning, was now talking with a girl named Nakajima, perhaps planning to spend time with her after school. She seemed to notice us, but right after, the two of them left the classroom side-by-side.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The caf&#xe9; at Keyaki Mall is good, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had no particular reason to refuse, so just as I was about to give a brief reply&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That will be on Hashimoto Masayoshi&apos;s treat, correct?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not that I wouldn&apos;t treat you if you&apos;re telling me to... but hey, why are you coming along?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Since you called me a phantom, I thought I would make good on your words for the sake of consistency. For the honor of phantoms.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wasn&apos;t sure if it was necessary to be consistent or protect the honor of spiritual beings, but she probably didn&apos;t approve of Hashimoto and I talking about various things by ourselves.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Jeez. Do you intend to monitor me so thoroughly?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s a path that cannot be avoided for the sake of sound class management. Well, I won&apos;t be asking for anything too expensive, so please rest assured. I&apos;m a woman who is kind to wallets, you know.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I said I&apos;m not treating you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;ll treat Ayanokouji Kiyotaka but not me? Is this... gender discrimination...?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I couldn&apos;t tell if her face was one of astonishment, but Morishita&apos;s eyes widened as she muttered.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I shall post on social media and request an all-out assault from my comrades.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She promptly took out her phone and began to tap her fingertips on it over and over.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ah, geez, whenever you show up, the conversation never moves forward.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you wish for the conversation to proceed, why not graciously pay the price for some tea? It&apos;s a small price to pay for things to go smoothly.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Agh, damn it, fine. I&apos;ll treat you, so at least be a little quiet while we&apos;re having a serious discussion. That&apos;s an order, got it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps those words were the deciding factor, as Morishita gave a small nod and immediately closed her mouth. Then, she pressed her left thumb and index finger together and made a small sliding motion from right to left across her lips. I supposed it meant she was zipping her mouth shut.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After confirming that she&apos;d actually gone quiet, we started walking again, and Hashimoto looked at me and began to speak.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I spent all day yesterday looking into the other classes.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Did you get any results?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Unfortunately, there wasn&apos;t anything you could call a real find. I guess it&apos;s no surprise that it&apos;s hard to make a move in a special exam with no rules explained. All three classes were quiet. Or rather, I should say they&apos;re no different than usual.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This probably wasn&apos;t the main topic; Hashimoto continued while lightly reporting on it and moving on.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Those instructions you gave us last night, or rather, your idea... did you tell Ichinose about it too?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Of course. As allies, we need to share information.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Is that so? Well, it&apos;s more convenient for us if Class D ranks high right now anyway. If we take first place and Ichinose takes second, then there&apos;s nothing to complain about.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It wasn&apos;t that he was completely without complaints, but for now, it was probably just a confirmation to be safe.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If the exam is just like you predicted, Ayanokouji, then Ryuuen&apos;s class is very likely to lose again. If Horikita&apos;s class is even one step too late in noticing these rules, it&apos;ll be irreversible. And even if there&apos;s an unexpected exam waiting for us, we won&apos;t lose if it&apos;s a battle of academics. I think we&apos;ve got this one in the bag.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The moment you let your guard down is when the rug gets pulled out from under you. Besides, Horikita&apos;s no fool. She already realized as of yesterday the possibility that &apos;school life attitude&apos; is being watched, just as I told you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I told him that with conviction, he stopped walking for a moment and looked back at me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Huh? Is that right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, after sensing from my demeanor that my statement was true, he started walking again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How can you say for sure that she&apos;s figured it out?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It just means that getting a class to unite isn&apos;t that simple.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I told him only that, Hashimoto must have understood something, as he let out a short whistle.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You must have a skilled scout, or maybe you&apos;ve got a spy planted in there&#x2014;either way, you&apos;re skillfully extracting the situation.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Normally, the inquisitive Hashimoto would probably want to pursue the matter further, including whether I was already using Yamamura, but he didn&apos;t. He understood instinctively that it wasn&apos;t a wise move to carelessly dig too deep here and worsen my impression of him.</p>",
