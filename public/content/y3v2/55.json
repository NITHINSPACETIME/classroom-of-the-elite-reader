Her expression is somewhat serious, somewhat delicate.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In her line of sight, the second-year Ayanokoji Kiyotaka was walking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Tsubaki, do you want to move up to Class A?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Not really. They say that&apos;s what the goal of the school is, then isn&apos;t it something like a mission for the enrolled students to give it their all?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Not much time has passed since I met you, but you don&apos;t seem like the type to act like she&apos;s carrying a mission.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe. But aren&apos;t you the same, Utomiya-kun? You don&apos;t seem interested in things like Class A or special privileges.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Averting her gaze from Ayanokouji, Tsubaki turns her eyes to Utomiya, who is sitting next to her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Seeing this, Utomiya looks somewhat awkward and turns his face away, towards the outside window.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s Housen and Nanase.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hm...?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In the line of sight of Utomiya, who was muttering to change the subject, were two first-year Class D students who were about to pass by Ayanokouji.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It looked like there might be some kind of contact, but there was no exchange of words, only Nanase giving a polite nod.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Coincidence? Or not?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t say anything just from that. But the bandage on Ayanokouji&apos;s left hand&#x2014;it piques my interest a bit.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;He was wearing something like that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Tsubaki, who hadn&apos;t noticed, shifted her gaze to Utomiya once again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Maybe something had happened. Knowing Housen&apos;s personality, it wouldn&apos;t be surprising if he started it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You mean he injured his hand? Housen-kun looked unharmed, though.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If they clashed somewhere, Ayanokouji probably chose not to fight back. There&apos;s a risk in carelessly injuring your opponent.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh? But for that to happen, wouldn&apos;t Ayanokouji-senpai also need a certain level of skill?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;His actual fighting ability is unknown, but I can&apos;t imagine him losing to someone at Housen&apos;s level. I can tell that much just by watching his usual demeanor and presence.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&apos;Housen-kun&apos;s level&apos;... Are you serious? He seems to just rampage around as he pleases, though.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What surprised Tsubaki was not the high evaluation of Ayanokouji, but the low estimation of Housen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s just because everyone around him is weak. &#x2015;&#x2015;Probably.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Feeling he had said too much, Utomiya trailed off.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Men are creatures who bluff. Most of them inwardly believe they are stronger than whoever they face.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was a good chance that Utomiya&apos;s remark was just a bluff, or that he simply had an abnormally high self-assessment, but he wasn&apos;t usually one to behave like that.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For the first time, Tsubaki felt a slight interest in her classmate, Utomiya.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I think I&apos;ve become a little interested in getting to know you, Utomiya-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Stop it. I don&apos;t pry into anyone&apos;s business, and I don&apos;t want anyone prying into mine.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ahh~. What a nice atmosphere~. Could it be that you two are dating?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A shadow fell between the two, and a girl appeared as if to interrupt them. It was Amasawa from first-year Class A.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We are not dating.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Utomiya denied it instantly. Tsubaki also nodded in agreement, not seeming particularly interested.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You think so? For that, your sense of distance seemed pretty close, though~&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s your imagination. Did you approach us just to say something so stupid? Or did you come over because you wanted to extract some information from us?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When Utomiya retorted in a harsh&#xa0;tone, Amasawa smiled, her lips curling in delight.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh, come on, I didn&apos;t mean it like that. Even if our classes are different, we&apos;re still first-years, so let&apos;s get along. Right, Tsubaki-chan?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry, but I&apos;ll pass. I&apos;m not exactly looking for friends.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So harsh, meow~&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Without looking particularly shocked, Amasawa gave a cute reply.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well then, I guess I&apos;ll save deepening our friendship for next time. See you later, Tsubaki-chan, Utomiya-kun.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Saying that, Amasawa left behind a blown kiss, turned her back, and walked away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Amasawa doesn&apos;t know about the special exam, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;She shouldn&apos;t. In Class A, only Takahashi and Ishigami know. However, I can&apos;t deny the possibility that they asked her to investigate even without knowing the details.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I see.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But in any case, it&apos;s a baffling exam. To think it&apos;s targeting a specific individual, only Ayanokouji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It might be something that&apos;s normal at this school, and we just don&apos;t know about it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...If that&apos;s the case, it makes the situation&#xa0;even more unsettling.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hello, Utomiya-kun. And Tsubaki-san as well.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A voice calls out from a short distance away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yagami from first-year Class B, who had come to the cafe, stopped and approached the two.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Now it&apos;s Yagami... He&apos;s the type to show up if you talk about the exam.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Can you blame him? The amount of private points you can get is on a whole other level.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you don&apos;t mind, could I join your conversation as well?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We were just having a boring small talk, that&apos;s all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It didn&apos;t look that way to me. It seemed you were watching Ayanokouji-senpai and Housen-kun&apos;s group.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh... So you&apos;ve been watching us from quite an early stage.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It was just a coincidence, though.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Either way, we&apos;re enemies.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s precisely because we are enemies that there is meaning in talking to each other, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Utomiya, Tsubaki, Housen, Nanase, Yagami.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">What they all had in common, Yagami included, was that they were all targeting Ayanokouji Kiyotaka.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Tsubaki and Utomiya had no way of knowing, but Amasawa was also involved in a certain special exam for first-year students.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"/><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">From this gathering, the story connects to the upcoming special exam on the uninhabited island&#x2015;.</p>",
