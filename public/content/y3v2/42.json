I&apos;m gonna borrow Ayanokouji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Though he offered a light apology, Hashimoto gave her no room to refuse, but Hiyori showed no sign of displeasure and bowed cheerfully. Then she waved and got on the elevator first.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto watched her go with a broad grin, waving back.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We meet often. Were you waiting for me to come back?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, something like that. Let&apos;s take a walk.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He half-forcibly led me out of the lobby and we walked down a path off the school route.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re really tolerant of Shiina, or rather, you&apos;re pretty close with her, aren&apos;t you? You&apos;re the one who gave her the flower, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why do you think that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no one else around at the time, so there was no way Hashimoto could&apos;ve seen me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s not a funny way to play dumb. There&apos;s no way it&apos;s nothing. Anyone could tell just by seeing how happy she looked holding that flower.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed Hashimoto felt that way after seeing Hiyori and I together.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re always going on about &apos;Shiina, Shiina,&apos; so there&apos;s been something on my mind. I figured I had to confirm it today, no matter what.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After a short pause, Hashimoto looked me straight in the eye.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;d probably be hard for anyone else to ask, so as the designated bad guy, I&apos;ll ask you straight up. Is Shiina someone especially close to you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">His expression clearly conveyed his seriousness.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is it a problem to have a specific person I&apos;m close to?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, I wouldn&apos;t go so far as to say it&apos;s a problem. But I&apos;m not exactly welcoming it, either.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto said, somewhat evasively. When I looked at him, he seemed a bit uncomfortable and averted his gaze.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not just me. Ichinose probably isn&apos;t too happy about it either, is she? I&apos;ve been hearing rumors that Ichinose likes you. The source of the rumor is Class D. In other words, she found out you broke up with Karuizawa and openly declared herself the next girlfriend candidate, right? I thought the way Ichinose looked at you wasn&apos;t exactly normal ever since we heard about the alliance together, but...anyway, I was sure you were going to get together with her&#x2014;or are you dating Ichinose?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We&apos;re not dating.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This should&apos;ve been the answer Hashimoto wanted, but instead of being pleased to hear it, he scowled.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...And why&apos;s that? If it&apos;s Ichinose, you couldn&apos;t ask for a better person to date, right? Honestly, even I, who&apos;ve barely had any contact with her, would say yes in a heartbeat if she confessed to me. She&apos;s on that level, you know? There&apos;s no reason to turn her down, is there?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sorry to burst your bubble while you&apos;re getting all worked up, but I haven&apos;t been confessed to.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even so, all you have to do is make a move, right? She already likes you, so you should just go for it without hesitation. Ah, I don&apos;t mean that in a weird way.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He hurriedly denied it, but that was a trivial distinction.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ichinose and I have an alliance. Nothing more, nothing less.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So you&apos;re saying you&apos;re just pragmatic allies? For the foreseeable future, too?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After asking that, he continued without waiting for my reply.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So then... does that mean you&apos;re going after Shiina right now?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m surprised. I didn&apos;t think you cared so much about other people&apos;s love lives.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;To be precise, I&apos;m just worried that those feelings might affect the outcome of the class competition.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was my business who I dated, but he was worried I might let my personal feelings get in the way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That seemed to be what he feared.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a very Hashimoto-like way of thinking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Nah, I don&apos;t even need to hear your answer; I already know. You cut ties with Horikita and the others you shared two years of hardship with to join us. I don&apos;t doubt for a second that your actions would change just because you got involved with one or two girls like Ichinose or Shiina.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And yet, you seem awfully hung up on it. Especially when it comes to Hiyori.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto was clearly placing more weight on it versus the situation with Ichinose.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;From an outsider&apos;s perspective, it&apos;s always felt to me like you treat Shiina differently.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto concluded by saying that if it was just a needless worry, then that was great, but it was already certain that I was, in fact, treating Hiyori in an indescribable way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That said, I wouldn&apos;t let her existence affect the class&apos;s performance. But speaking purely from personal feelings, I didn&apos;t want to treat Hiyori carelessly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I see.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So that&apos;s what it is.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s &apos;what it is&apos;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Perhaps I&apos;m in love with Hiyori.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can&apos;t say for sure what this feeling is just yet. But I might at least be harboring, or starting to harbor, feelings for Hiyori that I don&apos;t have for anyone else.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The unease and errors I&apos;d felt up to that point and their cause.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The reason it hadn&apos;t been easy to find was because it was something outside my empirical rules.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;W-Whoa, whoa, are you serious? Nah, what&apos;re you talking about, like this is your first time feeling something? You were just dating Karuizawa a little while ago, weren&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If the emotion I just identified is truly budding within me.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&apos;m even amazed by the strength of this thing called emotion and its unpredictable timing.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A desire to know more began to overflow.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>If I traced it back, would I be able to see it?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>When did I start to become conscious of Hiyori?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>What was different about her compared to other people?</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>I want to try digging as deep as I can.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><em>&#x2014;No, for now, I should probably stop these unnecessary delusions.</em></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Coming up with an answer right now, as if deducing a strategy, would&apos;ve been far too hasty.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No matter how it turned out, that emotion was extremely fascinating as a subject for experimentation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then... depending on the situation, are you planning on dating Shiina?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Didn&apos;t you believe that my actions wouldn&apos;t change? So why are you sticking your nose so deep into someone else&apos;s love life?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, just this once, y&apos;know... It&apos;s my view on love, I guess, but it&apos;s screaming at me that I absolutely have to check.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Your view on love, huh? Do you have a corresponding amount of experience with it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I asked this while keeping the expelled Maezono in mind.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Now you&apos;re underestimatin&apos; me a bit, Ayanokouji. It&apos;s not like I can brag about it, but between middle and high school, I&apos;ve dated two... no, to be precise, three people.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I surmised that the reason he was cagey about the last one was because he was referring to Maezono.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So? Are you planning to date Shiina? If you can&apos;t answer, that&apos;s fine too&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Whether we date or not involves the other person. It isn&apos;t something I can answer.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hah, well, yeah. But from the sound of it... if this is really your first time feeling this way, that&apos;d make it your first love, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Perhaps.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Right then, I possessed no way to deny it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No matter how many people you date, you only get one first love. And what&apos;s more, you almost never end up with that person. My own first love was a classmate in elementary school, but I couldn&apos;t even talk to her properly. If you treat your first love like that, it might feel romantic, or special, but in reality, it ain&apos;t all that. Guys are especially simple, y&apos;know, we&apos;ve got a tendency to unconditionally fall for any cute girl.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I fully understood that regardless of whether the object of affection was a man or a woman, the majority of people tended to be attracted to those with superior looks. Even looking at TV or magazines, the proportion of handsome men and beautiful women who caught the eye and gathered attention was overwhelmingly high.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So just go ahead and ditch that first love stuff. If a reasonably cute girl falls for you, your tenth love or your twentieth love can start just like that.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Despite his roundabout expressions, Hashimoto&apos;s way of thinking remained consistent.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Whether it&apos;s really your first love or whatever, stay away from Shiina. This is my strongest advice to you as your strategist, as your friend, and as a comrade aiming for Class A.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto was strongly wary of my relationship with Hiyori developing in an unexpected way.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s not a difficult concept, is it? You can get back together with Karuizawa, you can date Ichinose. Heck, any other girl would be fine. Just, not Shiina.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was clear that by deliberately repeating himself, Hashimoto was watching my reaction. It was plain to see that he would take either excessive agreement or denial as an unfavorable sign.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I understand your concern very well. However, you&apos;re counting your chickens before they hatch.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&#x2014;I can trust you, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You probably wouldn&apos;t believe me even if I answered, but you can trust me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">For me, Hiyori&apos;s existence was becoming indispensable.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">An existence that made me learn an unfamiliar emotion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I couldn&apos;t help but want to find out whether or not I could be certain it was what Hashimoto called a first love.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wanted to experience being swallowed by the irresistible waves of emotion and see how I would be carried away.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wanted to take both myself and the other person apart and seek the answer to the very end.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was true that I would remember his warning as a warning, but I had no intention of stopping.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Because I was already getting ready to dive in as deep as I could.</p>",
