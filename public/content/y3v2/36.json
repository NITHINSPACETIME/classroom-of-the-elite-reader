Not inviting me to what looks like a pretty important chat.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;How did you know we were here, Hashimoto Masayoshi?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Morishita, not even trying to hide her wariness, bluntly asked him for his reasoning.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Process of elimination. I had to run frantically around campus and Keyaki Mall. I was wonderin&apos; where you and Ayanokouji were going and well, I imagined you two were in a relationship you couldn&apos;t speak of.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Please limit your jokes to your face.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Now that&apos;s just hurtful. I&apos;m actually pretty confident about my looks, for your information.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was almost impressive that he hadn&apos;t followed us immediately after we left the classroom.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He&apos;d properly taken into account the risk of us spotting his tail.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m on your side, you know? You don&apos;t have to be so guarded.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto said that as he closed the distance with Morishita, who frequently and openly avoided him.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If you so much as lay a finger on me, I&apos;ll let out a maidenly scream that could tear silk, you brute.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I had a feeling that &apos;tearing silk&apos; and &apos;maidenly&apos; didn&apos;t really go together.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, since I couldn&apos;t imagine what kind of scream Morishita would let out, my interest was piqued just a little.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, I guess I can kinda see why you wouldn&apos;t want me involved this time, though.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Saying that, he shifted his gaze from Morishita, with whom he was making no progress, to Yamamura.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yamamura, now the subject of his gaze, looked uncomfortable, took a step back, and averted her eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Are you making Yamamura your aide, Ayanokouji?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s not what this is about. For me, this is still Class C, which I&apos;ve only just entered. There aren&apos;t many people I can rely on. However, Yamamura and I were together for the school trip and the training camp, and I believe we&apos;ve formed something of a bond. And I&apos;ve judged her to be a trustworthy person. It&apos;s not a matter of me <em>adding </em>Yamamura; I&apos;m hoping she&apos;ll <em>join </em>me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This reversal of roles was an extremely important distinction.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, well, looks like you&apos;ve really earned Ayanokouji&apos;s trust, eh, Miki-chan?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Uh... Mi-Miki...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Calling a girl by her first name without permission is rather inappropriate, wouldn&apos;t you say, Hashimoto Masayoshi?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hey, you&apos;re one to talk, calling people by their full name. And while we&apos;re at it, why don&apos;t you try getting along with me too, Ai-chan?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I absolutely refuse.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Harsh. What&apos;ll it take for you to trust me?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Trust isn&apos;t built in a day. No, in your case, perhaps I should say: it takes years to build trust, but only a moment to lose it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Morishita sharply thrust her index finger right in front of Hashimoto&apos;s face.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Even if Ayanokouji won&apos;t back me up, at least Miki-chan might&#x2014;huh?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In the instant his gaze was stolen by Morishita, Yamamura once again silently departed from the scene.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;As expected of a ninja&apos;s descendant. It seems the talent is passed down through the ages.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was pretty sure she didn&apos;t have any ancestors like that.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I will be leaving as well. Please don&apos;t follow me again.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t chase after anyone but Ayanokouji.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;My condolences,&quot; she said to me as a parting shot and without heading back to Keyaki Mall, Morishita seemed to be walking home from outside.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Once it was just the two of us, Hashimoto&apos;s shoulders slumped in an exaggerated fashion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Am I really that untrustworthy?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do you think you are?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...I don&apos;t.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then you&apos;ll have to be prepared for people to keep secrets from you or avoid you to some extent.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The truth hurts.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto wasn&apos;t an idiot. He understood and accepted that his past actions made his classmates give him the cold shoulder. And yet, he&apos;d gone out of his way to chase me down. It seemed like an action that could only bring him harm, not benefit.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Is it strange? That I&apos;d show up even when I&apos;m being told to stay away.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;d be a lie to say I wasn&apos;t wondering about it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hah... Of course I want to get to Class A. I&apos;m the guy who was willing to betray his own class to make that happen. I tried every trick in the book to cozy up to the other classes. But now, I&apos;ve decided this class can win. The fact that I threw away my Private Points is proof of that, right?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He&apos;d actually lost a large sum of Private Points, making it nearly impossible to buy a ticket to escape should his class sink. For Hashimoto, that was proof of his resolve to go down with his current ship, even if it meant being swallowed by the raging waves.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You&apos;re an amazing guy, you know. I feel like you&apos;ll win to some extent even without my help. I know it&apos;d be a smarter move not to show up like this and make myself disliked. And yet, the reason I can&apos;t help but stick my nose in... is because I want to do everything I can to help get us to Class A.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After he said that with a serious face, he immediately reverted to a joking expression.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Not that I expect you to believe me, though. But I&apos;m gonna keep pestering you anyway.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It seemed he intended to stick to his guns, fully aware of the criticism he would receive for being unable to suppress his true nature.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Do as you like. Though I think you&apos;ll be hearing endless complaints from Morishita...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s my one and only headache. She&apos;s so loud. So? You heading somewhere now?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;d like to, but I&apos;m stopping by the school.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The school? The library? Didn&apos;t you get to see Shiina on Friday?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No, she&apos;d already left for the day, so I couldn&apos;t meet her. So you could say this is me trying again.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...I see?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Although he let me go without any issue on Friday, Hashimoto&apos;s expression turned slightly suspicious, perhaps because he thought I was using the same line again as an excuse to turn him down.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Listen, you&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto started to speak, but then he let out a short laugh, exhaled, and shook his head.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s nothing. If you want to see Shiina, I&apos;ll graciously step aside today, too. Well then, I&apos;m off.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He turned his back and walked into Keyaki Mall.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I was a little concerned about how Hashimoto was acting, but it was getting late again.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I decided I should hurry to the library.</p>",
