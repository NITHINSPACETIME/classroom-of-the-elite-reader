I heard a rough knock, and when I unlocked the door to my room,&#xa0;Ibuki-san&apos;s opening words were dripping with sarcasm.&#xa0;It was hardly the attitude of someone about to come into another person&apos;s room and be served a meal.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s thanks to your wonderful flying kick. I&apos;m so very grateful.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In response to my sarcasm, Ibuki-san proudly puffed out her chest.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If it happens again, I&apos;ll be sure to kick you then, too, so be grateful.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wondered if, in her head, she&apos;d conveniently interpreted that as praise...</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She was making me regret ever having said that she&apos;d helped, even a little, as a catalyst for my recovery.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No, more importantly, to prevent any future victims, it seemed better to explain that this was a real problem, rather than using sarcasm that wouldn&apos;t get through to her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Kicking someone in the back from behind without warning is an extremely dangerous act, so don&apos;t do that again. At the very least, you should never do it to anyone but me.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was fortunate that I, the one who was kicked, had some knowledge of martial arts and that by chance the damage was kept to a minimum, but if the point of impact had been worse, I could&apos;ve been seriously injured. I made sure to warn her firmly about that part.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, Ibuki-san didn&apos;t take my words at face value and instead laughed mockingly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So it&apos;s fine to do it to you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It is not fine. But I won&apos;t be kicked by you again. After all, your prerequisite for kicking me was, &apos;if it happens again,&apos; wasn&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To think the precaution I&apos;d taken would pay off so quickly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Hmph. So you&apos;re sayin&apos; you&apos;ve completely recovered, then.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I can say it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if she found that completely unbelievable, Ibuki-san laughed as she kicked her shoes off messily and stepped inside. I picked up the disheveled shoes and rearranged them next to the two pairs that were already neatly lined up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">One pair belonged to me, the owner of this room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And the other pair&#x2014;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What do you think, Kushida? About what Horikita just said.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ibuki-san called out, turning her gaze to the owner of the other pair of shoes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Unbelievable.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She answered instantly, without so much as a glance in my direction, her eyes fixed on her phone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s what she says.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Like you, she won&apos;t readily agree with anything I say, so I pay it no mind.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I let out a soft sigh and moved from the entryway to the front of the kitchen.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Then, while taking the groceries I bought at the Keyaki Mall supermarket out of my reusable bag, I turned back and called out to them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Just sit wherever and play on your phone like she is. I don&apos;t mind if you watch TV, either.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t have to tell me twice.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Ibuki-san plopped down in her usual spot and then glanced around the room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kushida-san, who was watching Ibuki-san out of the corner of her eye, muttered quietly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s with that look on your face? It&apos;s disgusting.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Huh? Whose face did you say is disgusting?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There&apos;s only one other person nearby, so there&apos;s no need to say a name, is there?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Could be Horikita. She&apos;s got a gross face.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh, right. Yeah, that might be true. I guess that might&apos;ve been misleading.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I wondered if those two even realized whose room this was...</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;But I was talking about you, Ibuki-san.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Huh? What, what? Why are you trying to pick a fight all of a sudden? You want me to throw a pillow at you?&quot; snapped the always-combative Ibuki-san.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s because you had this look on your face, like, &apos;I&apos;m so happy to be in Horikita-san&apos;s room after so long~&apos;.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Wha&#x2014;? Wha&#x2014;? I&apos;m not happy! I just felt lucky I could get a free meal, that&apos;s all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Isn&apos;t that what you call being happy?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Absolutely not!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Casting a sideways glance at the living room, which had suddenly grown noisy with the addition of just one person, I began to cook with practiced hands. The ingredients I bought today cost twice my usual budget.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Still, compared to when I had given up on cooking for myself for some time in favor of simple meals from convenience stores, the expense was low.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The noisy sound of their two voices, something I&apos;d never found pleasant until just a little while ago.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But now, they reached my ears like strangely calming music.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A person&apos;s state of mind changed drastically with just a small shift in their perspective and way of thinking.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even as I chopped the vegetables with a kitchen knife, I reflected once again on the situation I found myself in.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A little while ago, I told Ibuki-san a small lie.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">My answer regarding my recovery. My assertion that I could say so with certainty.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was a clear lie.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I do believe I&apos;d managed to crawl my way from the depths of despair to a much better place.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Nevertheless, my wounded heart is far from fully healed.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">A lie told to prevent another victim of Ibuki-san&apos;s kicks.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">But the truth is, I wanted to lie to deceive myself into believing I was all right.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The reality that Ayanokouji-kun was gone was just that heavy&#x2014;</p>",
