Despite that, after getting dressed before 10:00 a.m., I promptly grabbed an umbrella and decided to head down to the dorm lobby. When I stepped into the elevator, the wet floor caught my eye. It was evident that students had been coming in and out of the dorms since early morning.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yo, mornin&apos;.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The moment I reached the first floor and the elevator doors opened, a male student in a hoodie, standing by the entrance, turned around, raising his hand as he greeted me. It was my classmate, Yoshida.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Morning.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After we exchanged brief greetings, Yoshida immediately looked toward the sofa.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Shimazaki came down a little while ago, too.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Having likely heard him, the now-named Shimazaki stood up and removed a white wireless earbud from his right ear. He put it away in a small case he took from his bag&#x2014;what I presumed to be a dedicated case for the wireless earbuds.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What were you listening to?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I asked as I followed Yoshida and walked over to Shimazaki.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;English listening practice for the entrance exams. Personally, English isn&apos;t my strong suit, so I want to devote as much time as possible to it now, while I still can.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I supposed he didn&apos;t want to waste even the short amount of time he spent waiting for his classmates.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Huh? You&apos;re bad at English? You get better scores than me, don&apos;tcha?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yoshida grumbled, looking up at the ceiling as if recalling past test results.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;There&apos;s no point in comparing me to you. In reality, it&apos;s my weakest subject.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, yeah. My bad for comparing us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yoshida apologized, albeit with a disgruntled look. Shimazaki possessed the academic ability and grades to naturally rank among the top of his year, but he likely achieved those results because he was aware of his weaknesses and took thorough measures to address them.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The time for third-year students to take their entrance exams was approaching. This level of awareness was just what you&apos;d expect from a former Class A student.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I thought that was a sarcastic remark, but you&apos;re not getting angry at it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I thought Yoshida was pretty short-tempered, but he didn&apos;t seem particularly angry at Shimazaki&apos;s comment.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, yeah, it&apos;s a little annoying, but this guy&apos;s always studying. I&apos;m not that into studying, and it&apos;s true there&apos;s a gap between us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was Yoshida&apos;s answer, but it might have also been that the two of them were simply good friends.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;By the way, have you seriously been doing nothing but studying lately?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I wonder. I try to set aside at least five hours a day to study, but that&apos;s about it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Of course, that five-hour period didn&apos;t include daily courses.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I didn&apos;t know how much time the average third-year high school student devoted to self-study, but it was certainly not a small amount.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Yoshida made an exaggerated gesture with his hands, as if to say there was no way he could do five hours.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The right to graduate from Class A is ultimately just a trump card. To get into a reasonably good university, this much is a given, and it doesn&apos;t just apply to me. I&apos;ll be stopping by the cram school at Keyaki Mall this evening as well.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Seriously? How much are you gonna study...&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Come to think of it, there was a cram school in the mall which was provided by ANHS. I had no use for that place, so I&apos;d never stopped by. I&apos;d heard that you could attend it for free, even without Private Points, if you met certain conditions, such as having no behavioral problems and a clear vision for your academic future, like a target university.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A cram school, huh? How many students actually go there?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I asked Shimazaki that, simply out of curiosity, he glared at me for some reason.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You don&apos;t know? Speaking only of third-years, there are twenty of us right now. Even so, the ratio should be quite low compared to a normal high school. But the numbers will probably grow as we head toward summer.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">So that was how many students were starting to prepare for the entrance exams.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Your grades aren&apos;t bad either, so wouldn&apos;t it be a good idea for you to at least show your face there?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was true that Yoshida was inferior compared to Shimazaki, but he still had high academic scores.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If he was considering university, it wouldn&apos;t be strange for him to start attending.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shimazaki probably recommended it with the best intentions, but Yoshida immediately refused.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;No way, not happening. I&apos;m fine with just an average university, just average. I can&apos;t stand the idea of being buried in my studies even on my days off when I could be hangin&apos; out with friends. It&apos;s suffocating, ain&apos;t it? Nothin&apos; but studying,&quot; he said, turning down the offer as he glanced sideways at the serious Shimazaki.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If that&apos;s the case, fine. I have no intention of forcing you to study. That&apos;s precisely why it&apos;s my own business what I do, when, and where, as long as it isn&apos;t a nuisance to you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shimazaki knitted his brows and glared at Yoshida, perhaps feeling that his attitude toward studying had been criticized.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;O-Of course, it&apos;s your own business. Don&apos;t be so mad.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In response, Yoshida hurriedly held up both hands, palms open, and offered an apology.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;A-Ahem. So? What&apos;s the reason you called me and Ayanokouji out on our day off?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He cleared his throat once, then asked Shimazaki for the reason, as if trying to change the subject.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a precious day off, an important day he would normally have spent studying on his own. Indeed, I was curious as to why someone like Shimazaki had invited us out.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The truth is, my business is only with Ayanokouji, but we aren&apos;t exactly on terms where we can just go out and talk. I figured things would proceed more smoothly if you were here.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Apparently, Yoshida had nothing to do with the matter itself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The word &apos;talk&apos; coming up in the conversation gave me a slightly clearer idea of his objective.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;So that&apos;s what this is about. Well, people naturally tend to rely on me, after all.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even though he expressed how much of a pain it was, he narrowed his eyes, looking somewhat pleased.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Anyway, since you asked, I&apos;ll be sure to help you out. Ayanokouji, you better hear Shimazaki out properly.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As if passing the responsibility on to me, Yoshida placed a hand on my shoulder and said so.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That depends on the topic of discussion. What exactly did&#xa0;you want to talk about?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as Shimazaki said, my relationship with him was by no means a deep one; there was still some distance between us.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There had to be a clear reason for him to go out of his way to approach someone like me for a talk.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Another thing that bothered me was that he&apos;d asked me to bring an umbrella.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If it were just for a talk, there would&apos;ve been no need to go out on a rainy day;&#xa0;it wouldn&apos;t have been difficult to just talk in someone&apos;s room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shimazaki glanced around briefly before looking me straight in the eye.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Today, I&apos;m going to make you confess all of your secrets.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Secrets?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Talking about it here won&apos;t solve anything. You&apos;ll understand if you just follow me for now.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With that, Shimazaki left the lobby, immediately opened his umbrella, and started walking at a rather brisk pace.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What the heck? I wonder where he&apos;s headed.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Who knows. He said Keyaki Mall, but&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">After briefly exchanging glances with Yoshida, we decided to follow Shimazaki as well.</p>",
