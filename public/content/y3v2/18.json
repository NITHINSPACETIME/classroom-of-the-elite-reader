I will not be accepting any questions this time.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, but&#x2014;!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">With a conspicuous sigh, Chabashira-sensei turned only her head and looked at Ike-kun.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I&apos;m not being intentionally cold. It&apos;s simply a rule that we teachers cannot elaborate on the specific rules of this exam.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Her harsh tone made the expressions of the classmates, including Ike-kun, stiffen even more.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I want you to stop acting so spoiled and show me you&apos;ve grown. I&apos;d like you to make me think you&apos;re different from when you first enrolled.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Chabashira-sensei declared, as if to drive the point home.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The fact that it wasn&apos;t harassment and that she never intended to spend time explaining the rules from the start was something we were supposed to infer from the unnatural timing of the announcement, right before the end of homeroom.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">She swung the classroom door wide and left without fuss.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even after the door slammed shut, the classroom didn&apos;t fall silent; rather, the teacher&apos;s departure only made it grow noisier.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;She seriously left. How&apos;re we supposed to take this on without even hearing the rules?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;She said she wasn&apos;t being intentionally cold, but wasn&apos;t she kinda cold?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, she was super cold. Could it be because we lost the last special exam?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;We did our best, though.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The classmates continued to grumble and complain as they pleased.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I get why you wanna say that, but calm down, will ya? Kickin&apos; up a fuss ain&apos;t gonna tell us the rules.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Perhaps to signal &#x2018;you&#x2019;re being loud&#x2019;, Sudou-kun stuck his pinky into his left ear as he chided the restless students.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Sudou-kun is right. The lack of a rules explanation isn&apos;t something to get so worked up about. The other classes are fighting under the same conditions, so there&apos;s no advantage or disadvantage at this stage.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In concert with Sudou-kun&apos;s strong, resonant voice, Hirata-kun also said as much to soothe the students.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s easy for you to say, but we can&apos;t do anything if we don&apos;t know the rules. Wouldn&apos;t it be better to just go in blind a week from now?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I think that would&apos;ve been better, too. This feels like we&apos;re just being strung along.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shinohara-san strongly agreed with the unceasingly complaining Ike-kun.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I could understand what they wanted to say, but the special exam had now been announced.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In that case, all we could do was face it seriously.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To begin with, it was a mistake to assume there were no hints before even thinking about it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I couldn&apos;t just stand by and watch until things got out of hand, so I decided to speak up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The special exam doesn&apos;t start until tomorrow, so just panicking here is a waste of time. First, we should calm down, brainstorm ideas, and discuss things.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You say &apos;ideas,&apos; but what can we do if the rules haven&apos;t been explained?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Here, Hondou-kun, looking exasperated, stared at the large, powered-off monitor that served as a blackboard, re-emphasizing that things were different from usual.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;If we pool our wisdom, it&apos;s possible we can get closer to the rules. We just need to imagine what kind of special exam will be held and prepare our options.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Yeah, well, maybe you&apos;re right, but can we really overlook our teacher&apos;s attitude? I&apos;m talkin&apos; about how cold she was, you know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Shinohara-san seemed to have really disliked Chabashira-sensei&apos;s response, as she continued to fixate on that point.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">And several other students agreed with her.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I really didn&apos;t think it should take priority over the content of the special exam, but...</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was true that Chabashira-sensei had become much softer in her demeanor compared to before. In fact, during the second half of our second year, the frequency with which she showed us a smile increased to the point where she was almost unrecognizable from her former self.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Now in our third year, Ayanokouji-kun transferred, and our teacher was hurt, too.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Sometimes that showed in her attitude. But wasn&apos;t that proof that she felt Class A would be forced into a difficult situation from now on...?</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">...or perhaps she was limiting unnecessary kindness and smiles to a minimum, as a way to make us refocus.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Above all, demanding kindness for free, for whatever reason, was simply out of line.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">That was how I took it, but they didn&apos;t.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The frustrated gazes of some students were directed at me, Hirata-kun, and even Sudou-kun.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Everyone was suffering, burdened with an indescribable frustration.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When I thought about our history, I felt no small amount of resistance to reprimanding them harshly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I can&apos;t forget that everyone in the class was also a victim, caught up in the discord created by Ayanokouji-kun&apos;s departure.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In the end, no satisfactory discussion took place before the first period began, and only time passed.</p>",
