But I did nothing out of the ordinary. I just woke up in the morning, went to school, paid attention in class, spent my free time after school and prepared for the next day.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&apos;d given my classmates one instruction, but otherwise, they were free.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">They could carry on as usual, or they could study more. I left it all up to their own discretion.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was still quite early for school, but with nothing else to do, I decided to keep up my early departure routine for a little while longer. I turned off the TV, put on my shoes, and stepped out into the hall.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">When the elevator arrived and its doors opened, five girls and one boy were already inside.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This wasn&apos;t an unusual sight, as the elevators were often crowded on mornings before school.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Considering the capacity, I could&apos;ve squeezed in, but the three Class A girls who happened to be riding&#x2014;Shinohara, Matsushita, and Inogashira&#x2014;were staring at me with somewhat cold eyes.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">There was no point in forcing my way on, so I decided to let it go and wait for the next one.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The stairs were an option, but I chose to wait for the next elevator.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">This one also had three girls on it, but there was still some room.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, my feet felt a little heavy, and for a moment, I hesitated to get on. But there was clearly space, and it would&apos;ve been unnatural not to get on. With that thought, I stepped forward. I turned around inside the elevator&#xa0;to face the doors, and it soon arrived at the first floor.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">As the last one to get on, I was naturally the first to step out into the lobby. I took a few steps and stopped, and the two girls behind me immediately walked past.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Good morning.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">One girl remained. She spoke to me from behind in a small voice, careful not to startle me. It was Hiyori, who&apos;d been in the elevator with me. I&apos;d seen her nearby or passed her in the halls several times like this, but we&apos;d never had a proper conversation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Good morning.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Have you been...well?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Same as always.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was a brief exchange. For some reason, I struggled, unable to keep the conversation going.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&apos;d envisioned going to the library, first apologizing about my class transfer, and then maybe talking about books... I wondered if it was because we were in such an unexpected place.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">No, that was just a flimsy excuse. In this small community, I never knew when or where a coincidence like this would leave us alone together. It could&apos;ve happened yesterday or the day before. It was something I should&apos;ve been able to anticipate from the start.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&#x2014;And yet, I couldn&apos;t find the words to say. That never happened before.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Feeling a strange sensation, we started to walk together.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was only a short, few-minute walk to school, but I was sure a conversation would arise naturally as we went.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Or so I hoped.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">However, at times like this, unexpected events tended to pile up.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as we stepped outside, looking for the right moment to speak, I noticed a trio standing a short distance from the dorms, watching the lobby: Hashimoto, Morishita, and Shiraishi. It seemed I was their target, as Hashimoto approached me alone, acting as their representative.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&apos;Yo, good mornin&apos;. And mornin&apos; to you too, Shiina.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto offered his morning greeting with his usual casual demeanor.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&apos;Wanted to check on somethin&apos; related to our class before we get to school, y&apos;see.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I always welcomed contact from Class C students, but the timing of this couldn&apos;t have been worse. But Hiyori, either reading the mood or wanting to get away quickly, greeted the three of them and started walking to school by herself.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&apos;Whoops, was I interruptin&apos; somethin&apos;...? My bad.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">He apologized for form&apos;s sake, but considering he was using it as a convenient way to drive away an outsider who wasn&apos;t his classmate, it was clear his choice of words was deliberate.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;It&apos;s fine.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">If I wanted to have a proper talk with Hiyori, the issue could be resolved simply by heading to the library as I&apos;d originally planned.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I&apos;d known that for a long time. I kept procrastinating, but considering what happened today, I knew I had to go and properly clear the air soon.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, you certainly don&apos;t discriminate, do you? Are you trying to make a move on Shiina Hiyori, too?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Why would you think that?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That&apos;s what you say, but I wonder what the truth of the matter is.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s wrong with that? It doesn&apos;t matter how many cute girls he gets close to. Besides, setting your sights on Shiina-san... I&apos;d say you have excellent taste. I think it shows a wonderful eye for beauty!&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I could see Shiraishi&apos;s eyes sparkle as she watched Hiyori walk away. It brought back memories of my recent conversation with Shimazaki and Yoshida.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In any case, there was no point in continuing this pointless conversation, so I prompted Hashimoto to move things along.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;&apos;Bout that special exam plan you sent out yesterday. I wanted to confirm it with ya.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I was curious about that as well. Since Hashimoto-kun appeared to be waiting for Ayanokouji-kun, I decided to take the opportunity to join you.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;And Morishita, you too? You seem surprisingly interested&#x2014;&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I am merely an onlooker.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">The onlooker declared curtly.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;You laid out the instructions for the special exam in the group chat last night, right? When I saw that, I was impressed, man. Thought you were finally gettin&apos; serious about leadin&apos; us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">I posted in the group chat that I once again believed it was highly likely the school was making our daily conduct part of the exam. I conveyed some finer points, such as recommending that students who weren&apos;t confident in their actions shouldn&apos;t leave the dorms, as weekends couldn&apos;t be taken lightly in addition to our weekday behavior.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I bet you&apos;ll manage the class more stably than we could ever imagine. Things were a real pain in other ways back when it was Sakayanagi. You think so too, don&apos;t you, Shiraishi?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto tossed the topic to Shiraishi, seeking her agreement, but he received an unexpected reply.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, I hold our former leader, Sakayanagi-san, in high regard. It&apos;s true that she had a habit of making decisions on her own as she pleased, but she maintained our position as Class A for two years without ever once letting it fall.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In reality, if an irregular existence like mine hadn&apos;t been there, she likely would have maintained control of the class for three years without issue and led them to graduate as Class A.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I, too, agree with that statement. Only Hashimoto Masayoshi seems oddly negative, despite having been by her side.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s with that suspicious look...? I&apos;m just sayin&apos; it was a huge pain precisely because I was her aide, you know? Besides, in the end, it was Sakayanagi&apos;s fault we dropped to Class C as a result of her doin&apos; whatever she wanted.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Hashimoto spoke with an attitude that suggested he was completely without fault.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh? I don&apos;t believe so. Shall I specifically elaborate on the reason for you?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;...Nah, I&apos;ll pass. Just listenin&apos; to your crazy talk is exhausting.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;That would be wise, traitorous Hashimoto THE <em>Righteous</em>.&quot;<sup id=\"fnref-1-eea6e4d7-8987-50ea-8261-1c9f1ec8ffb4\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1-eea6e4d7-8987-50ea-8261-1c9f1ec8ffb4\" data-ref=\"1\" epub:type=\"noteref\">[1]</a></sup></p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;What&apos;s with &apos;THE&apos;? What do you mean, &apos;THE&apos;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">To this incomprehensible nickname, Hashimoto retorted like a comedian.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Oh my, what do you mean by &apos;traitorous&apos;?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Don&apos;t mind it at all. That&apos;s just Morishita sayin&apos; whatever comes to mind, like always. More importantly, let me get us back on topic.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Just as Hashimoto got the conversation back on track and was about to return to the topic of the exam, Kondou and Komiya from Ryuuen&apos;s class emerged from the lobby and approached us. Their timing was so perfect it seemed planned.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;The new class leader and his cronies, huh? Scheming somethin&apos; evil this early in the morning?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Kondou circled around us, glancing at everyone.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Long time no see, Kondou. Looks like you&apos;ve been keepin&apos; your distance from our class lately.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Well, things are different now. We&apos;re Class B, and you guys are Class C. We&apos;re only ever on guard against the classes above us.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">Even as he said we weren&apos;t worth his time, his words were contradicted by his attempt to make contact, and above all, a faint, unconcealable tension leaked from Kondou&apos;s voice.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Then you could&apos;ve just ignored us today, too, you know?&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;I just thought you might get lonely if I didn&apos;t mess with you a little.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It&apos;d been the same the other day when Ryuuen came into our classroom, but the usually fussy Morishita became abnormally quiet, like a mouse. At that moment, she was staring at the trees with a feigned air of ignorance.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Besides, I figured if you were havin&apos; an interesting chat, you could let us in on it.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">&quot;Unfortunately, we were just lamentin&apos; the start of another boring day.&quot;</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">It was almost certain that Ryuuen had ordered Kondou and his group to decipher the exam rules. Perhaps they were just trying to get any hint they could. Or perhaps, like us, they&apos;d already pinpointed the exam&apos;s rules and sent Kondou and the others as agents.</p><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\">In the end, Kondou and his group, who stuck to our side, continued to apply silent pressure without saying or doing a thing, right up until we entered the school building and went our separate ways in the classroom.</p><hr class=\"footnote-rule\"/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li data-id=\"eea6e4d7-8987-50ea-8261-1c9f1ec8ffb4\" data-ref=\"1\" class=\"footnote first-footnote\" id=\"fn-1-eea6e4d7-8987-50ea-8261-1c9f1ec8ffb4\"><p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align: left\"><a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1-eea6e4d7-8987-50ea-8261-1c9f1ec8ffb4\">[1]: </a>Hashimoto&apos;s given name Masayoshi (&#x6b63;&#x7fa9;) means justice/righteousness, Morishita is jokingly saying &quot;the&quot; in english here to emphasize how his last name means righteous even though he&apos;s a &quot;traitor.&quot;</p></li></ol>",
