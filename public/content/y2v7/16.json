Time really flies. Hey folks, Kinugasa here. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Lately, eating ginger has been something of an obsession of mine. I’m totally on a ginger kick. I regularly buy a few kilos of it and grate it up, then buy a few kilos more, grate it up again, and so on. I’ve been eating it with both meat and vegetables. I especially love the combination of king trumpet mushrooms, ginger, and lemon sauce. It’s the best. Eh he he, I kind of revealed a little something about my private life that no one is interested in.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Ahem. I went a little off the rails because I didn’t have anything in particular to write about, but let’s move on to the topic at hand, shall we?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">The main focus of the story in this volume was the November Cultural Festival. I’m sure that some of you would have liked to have seen other students wearing costumes too, but I ask that you please understand that there may be an opportunity for that another time. At any rate, the story is progressing smoothly without stopping. Soon, the second semester will end, the students will have their winter vacation, and they’ll be thrust into the turbulent third semester. Although there have been a few more volumes than I initially expected in this story, the second-year arc has finally passed its turning point. I feel like, step by step, we’re getting closer to the conclusion of the story.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Will Ayanokouji be able to graduate from school safely? Where will each class end up when everything’s said and done? I think that you’ll start to be able to see the bigger picture bit by bit now, and I hope that you’re eagerly looking forward to what’s to come. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Oh, and also! Also, also! The second season of the anime will finally air this July! I’ve been waiting for this for a long time. I’ve been eagerly awaiting this so much that I even asked myself how much longer </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">I </span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">could possibly wait! I’m so excited to see Ayanokouji and the rest in action again for the first time in many years. And also, since a third season is also planned… Yeah, hmm… How can I put it? I’m filled with deep emotions.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">So, to all of you who like </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Classroom</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">, and those of you who don’t, those of you who are interested in the story, and those of you who aren’t, it would make me immensely happy if you could tune in and watch. I’ll also be watching, as someone who has probably been awaiting the second season more eagerly than anyone else. Yay!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Lastly, I’d like to make a serious announcement, and I humbly ask for your understanding in this matter. The </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Classroom of the Elite Year 2</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> anime will be starting soon, and I also wrote </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Classroom of the Elite Volume 0</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> as a special bonus for the Blu-ray &amp; DVD release. It was very tough work. As the name </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Volume 0</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> suggests, the book is about getting closer to Ayanokouji’s past. I’m very grateful to have gotten Tomose-shi’s full cooperation as the illustrator, and the number of illustrations in that book is in line with the main volumes. I humbly ask that you consider checking it out.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">That’s all for this time. Thank you for bearing with me through this postscript. I hope to see you all again sometime within the year.</span></p>\r\n",
