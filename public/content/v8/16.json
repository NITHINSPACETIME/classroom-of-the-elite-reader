Any day now!” I always make those announcements, and there’s always a delay. Truly terrible, isn’t it?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">And so I will state clearly and unequivocally: I will stop making declarations about release dates in the postscript. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">It’s been about seven or eight weeks since I’ve hurt my fingers, I think? Even though that much time has passed, I’m still a ways off from a full recovery. I’m still receiving treatment and trying to take care of myself, wondering if I can maintain the four-month schedule I’ve been on until now. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Anyhow, before I even noticed, it was already May. Time really does fly, doesn’t it? Time has passed in the blink of an eye, considering it’s been a full three years since I first released </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Classroom of the Elite</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">. Back when I was working on volume 1, part of me didn’t believe I’d be able to go on selling my works and writing for this long. I’m extremely delighted. But I’ve also become keenly aware that it’s not just my fingers that are aching. My entire body is falling apart. I’m really going to take better care of myself.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">In volume 8 of </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">Classroom</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">, we started seeing more of the upperclassmen. A wide variety of characters showed up: the good-for-nothings, the shady, and the dependable. I hope you enjoyed reading this volume. And the next volume, volume 9, well, it, nnngh, will c-come out in S-S-Sept…aagghh. No, I’ve already decided to stop making announcements! Stop!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">All right, that’s enough of my idiocy. You know, personally, there’s one thing I’ve really wanted for a long time now. I guess you could call it a secret desire. I really want a massage chair. Like, </span><span style=\" font-style: italic; font-size: 1.00em;\">really, really</span><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\"> want it. But it’s expensive. On top of that, it would take up a lot of space that I don’t have. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"P_Prose_Formatting\"><span style=\" font-size: 1.00em;\">Seriously, I’ve been agonizing over this for years. In the end, I can’t decide. Will I ever buy one? Or will that day never come? Well, no matter how much time passes, I’ll continue to write about wanting it and never buy it. If anyone out there knows about some wonderful massage chairs, please tell me about it.</span></p>\r\n",
